00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The modernist human being is a disgraced one.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.584
Not to mention that he is empty within.

00:00:06.584 --> 00:00:12.645
We are unaware of all the different types of freedom that human history has produced.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:17.807
We only know the political freedom that Western States have produced for us.

00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:21.237
This is because the history of freedom, which we don't practice today

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:25.864
but mankind practiced in many forms before the 19th century,

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:27.714
is dead.

00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:32.166
It was killed by Western freedom.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.996
Do you view the Islamic 'Futuh' as occupations?

00:00:38.468 --> 00:00:40.696
Hello, this is Fnjan Podcast from thmanyah,

00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:42.760
and I'm Abdul Rahman Abu Maleh.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.952
I remember a saying that goes like this:

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:51.672
"That everything around us that we can call life is made by people like us."

00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:54.284
They are not smarter than us at all.

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:55.993
I believe in this idea.

00:00:55.993 --> 00:01:02.255
However, the problem this episode wants to solve in one way or another

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:07.666
is that all this life and its concepts are Western products.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:11.413
The freedom we are familiar with has a Western definition.

00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:14.602
What is a human, and why does he exist?

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:16.399
The definition is Western.

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.793
The same is true for work, retirement, equality, and countless other examples.

00:01:21.793 --> 00:01:25.502
My guest has a mega project.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:30.693
His goal is to destabilize the dominant discourse of Islamic studies in the West.

00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:32.706
Because he thinks

00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:36.289
that the West looked at us and understood us

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.727
with an orientalist lens

00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:40.785
that resulted in a disaster.

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:46.542
He says: I studied European history to understand Islamic history.

00:01:46.542 --> 00:01:51.541
And Islamic history, as we know it today, is not our history.

00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:53.701
Then what is Islamic history?

00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:57.141
How Islamic Shari‘a originated and developed

00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:59.009
from the beginning of the Rightly Guided Caliphate,

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.529
and through Islamic States,

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:06.127
until the emergence of the modern state?

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:10.290
Once you open the door to the modern state and modernity,

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.387
it opens doors and raises questions that are philosophical, moral, and fundamental.

00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:19.261
These questions, discussions, and criticisms

00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:22.702
is what my guest aspires to be presented

00:02:22.702 --> 00:02:26.567
in the corridors of Arab and Western universities and academies

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:30.125
My guest is Dr. Wael Hallaq

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:37.531
Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, Department of Middle Eastern Studies,

00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:42.695
His PhD thesis was titled "Was the Gate of Ijtihad Closed?"

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:47.885
Perplexing questions have led him to this question

00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:50.144
which made him write his PhD thesis.

00:02:50.144 --> 00:02:53.876
This episode is packed full of perplexing questions,

00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:58.567
and answers that lead to more questions.

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:00.234
Before we begin

00:03:00.234 --> 00:03:03.573
this episode, like many episodes of Fnjan Podcast,

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:08.971
is full of materials and references related to topics raised by a guest in the course of the conversation

00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:12.856
or important information from the research and preparation journey.

00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:15.727
We collected it for you in the form of an email.

00:03:15.727 --> 00:03:21.025
If you are interested, the link to subscribe to the Fnjan newsletter is below

00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:23.996
in the description box of this episode.

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:26.876
Now, let's start.

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:30.883
How long do you anticipate the interview will last?

00:03:30.883 --> 00:03:35.261
(I mean, there is no specific time in my mind.)

00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:38.287
What is the optimal duration?

00:03:38.287 --> 00:03:42.427
The ideal duration is when you deliver your idea perfectly. Really.

00:03:42.427 --> 00:03:45.834
Some episodes take an hour, and that was enough.

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:49.562
Others take up to 4 hours.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.859
- And they are very successful.
- (Yes, they are.)

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.695
I was talking to one of your guests about it.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:04:02.930
One episode was more than three hours long, but it had a few million viewers.
- That's true.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.127
An episode was a little over three hours long, and it was viewed fifty million times.

00:04:08.127 --> 00:04:09.526
Masha Allah

00:04:09.526 --> 00:04:12.105
- It was about relationships.
- Yes, that one.

00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:17.094
You could say that that episode touched a lot of people on a personal level.

00:04:17.094 --> 00:04:20.280
But there are strange episodes, and I don't know the numbers exactly.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.830
I mean, I don't know how it became popular.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.737
There was that episode with George Saliba.

00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:27.043
He is a colleague of mine.

00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:30.085
It targeted the elites, presumably.

00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:33.176
That episode has reached seven million now.

00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:35.136
Yes, I have noticed that.

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:36.855
It's hard to anticipate acceptance.

00:04:36.855 --> 00:04:38.986
(It's hard to know that beforehand.)

00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:40.381
Yes, I can't.

00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:42.907
It's like writing a book.

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:48.830
When you write a book, it could be received normally

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.422
or it could be very famous.

00:04:51.422 --> 00:04:54.950
Although they are from the same author, he wouldn't know.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.924
It applies to many things, such as books and films.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.614
True.

00:05:01.614 --> 00:05:05.354
It's like a chemical mixture,

00:05:05.354 --> 00:05:09.132
and it's hard to predict it's precise compounds.

00:05:09.132 --> 00:05:14.461
The more you want to spread a subject, the less it does.

00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:16.474
But if you made a subject and focused on it,

00:05:16.474 --> 00:05:18.098
Yes, that's true.

00:05:18.098 --> 00:05:20.596
Is it possible to take breaks?

00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:21.882
(Any time.)

00:05:21.882 --> 00:05:24.359
And will you cut it?

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:26.084
Yes, we will cut it and rework it.

00:05:26.084 --> 00:05:28.373
Will you add something?

00:05:28.373 --> 00:05:29.697
(Not at all.)

00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:32.441
- So, the viewer will not know?
- (No, they don't.)

00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:33.455
Okay.

00:05:33.455 --> 00:05:36.320
- Whenever it suits you
- Excellent.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.336
But there is an issue

00:05:39.336 --> 00:05:42.129
I want to learn more about it from you.

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.812
Do you expect people to understand Wael Hallaq's project?

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:50.058
Because I asked about that, and I'm not sure.

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:58.842
Of course, it depends on the type of book or research.

00:05:58.842 --> 00:06:03.039
Or maybe the Wael Hallaq project as a whole.

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.279
If we want to talk about the books,

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:11.958
I imagine there is a point of difference and a big disparity between the responses of the audience.

00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.133
Especially the book 'The Impossible State'.

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:18.767
It created quite a stir.

00:06:18.767 --> 00:06:27.331
I can say that there are certain elites who understood the book accurately and excellently.

00:06:27.331 --> 00:06:34.957
Even some Muslims in America

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:41.132
managed to to dive in the book's meanings

00:06:41.132 --> 00:06:43.772
and they understood that book accurately.

00:06:43.772 --> 00:06:50.754
And sometimes I feel like I wish I had deputed them to speak on my behalf.

00:06:50.754 --> 00:06:57.534
However, there were other instances where the book was abused.

00:06:57.534 --> 00:07:00.390
There were two kinds of abuse.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.575
Abuse with good intention.

00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:05.037
This is because they didn't understand the book.

00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:09.474
Or they don't have the necessary background to understand the book.

00:07:09.474 --> 00:07:13.038
This is normal, and you can't blame anyone for that.

00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:21.685
But there is a very small elite that has attacked the book with an impure intention.

00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:25.934
They want to destroy it and its project.

00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:34.151
They even want to destroy the integrity of the person who wrote the book.

00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:35.831
Arabs or Westerners?

00:07:35.831 --> 00:07:38.045
No, All of them are Arabs.

00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:48.259
Westerners and non-Arabs have more moderate reactions than some Arabs.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:53.527
The Impossible State has caused a stir for a reason.

00:07:53.527 --> 00:07:57.559
It's because of the intellectual battles that took place around the book.

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:01.273
I'm not the only party in defense or in the interpretation of the book.

00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:05.431
There are many people who defend the book.

00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:14.144
Because they believe in an overview of the problems we face today that is similar to mine.

00:08:14.144 --> 00:08:15.292
Excellent.

00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:19.864
I will try my best to make this episode reach as many people as possible.

00:08:19.864 --> 00:08:24.716
I think that there are many concepts that you bring up

00:08:24.716 --> 00:08:28.765
and if people were to understand it, it could reflect on their lives in general.

00:08:28.765 --> 00:08:31.830
Not necessarily nationwide

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.867
But on the personal and intellectual scope of any human

00:08:35.867 --> 00:08:39.666
- We will try as much as we can.
- Of course.

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:40.920
I hope.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.961
I want to go back to the point

00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:47.774
where you said at the start of your research

00:08:47.774 --> 00:08:51.776
that you tried to research European history to understand Islamic history.

00:08:51.776 --> 00:08:54.052
- (True.)
- And you said:

00:08:54.052 --> 00:08:58.030
Islamic history, as we know it today, is not our history.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:03.971
I would like to learn about the things that we don't know about our Islamic history.

00:09:03.971 --> 00:09:10.990
Writing history today is completely different from writing history before the 19th century.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:18.925
History as we know it today is born of 19th-century European practices.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:23.709
Even in Europe, it wasn't too long before the 19th century.

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:28.151
Of course, it's like a mathematical equation

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:31.787
that doesn't need to be proved.

00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:37.830
If we are starting from any discourse

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:43.013
that was written in the present, which means the 19th and 20th century,

00:09:43.013 --> 00:09:46.275
this means that we are reading history

00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:54.673
using given facts, perspectives, feelings, and ways of thinking from these two centuries.

00:09:54.673 --> 00:09:56.346
Add to that,

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:59.522
even if there was no colonization or anything else

00:09:59.522 --> 00:10:02.276
Even if we were just Muslims

00:10:02.276 --> 00:10:05.072
living without a colonial history

00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:08.298
that happened to us in the last two hundred years.

00:10:08.298 --> 00:10:09.325
Okay.

00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:12.361
Now you must include the colonialism.

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:19.201
European colonialism is unique in the human experience.

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:24.854
Few people understand that.

00:10:24.854 --> 00:10:28.955
Of course, Muslims occupied many states.

00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:32.669
It was called Al-Futuh.

00:10:32.669 --> 00:10:42.866
They weren't given a name that was equivalent to the word coloniality, colony, or colonialism.

00:10:42.866 --> 00:10:45.099
It was named Futuh.

00:10:45.099 --> 00:10:48.864
It's true that it was just a word.

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:53.821
However, it has deep implications and concepts.

00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:58.385
Because the Islamic Fatah (plural Futuh), for example,

00:10:58.385 --> 00:11:04.182
is of a certain quality that is completely different

00:11:04.182 --> 00:11:12.056
from European occupations, settlements, and colonizations in the 19th century

00:11:12.056 --> 00:11:16.943
and most of them happened in the 19th century.

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:20.146
Even when England entered India,

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:24.338
it couldn't subjugate it to its will.

00:11:24.338 --> 00:11:32.352
It couldn't remake India into what it thought was the real image of civilization.

00:11:32.352 --> 00:11:36.299
This lasted until the 19th century.

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:41.429
This was from the beginning, but in the middle of the 19th century

00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:49.254
India completely collapsed under the feet of the British Empire.

00:11:49.254 --> 00:11:52.221
Do you view the Islamic Futuh as occupations?

00:11:52.221 --> 00:11:56.632
Of course, Fatah is an occupation of land.

00:11:56.632 --> 00:12:00.987
By the way, 'occupation' is a modern word.

00:12:00.987 --> 00:12:03.938
Futuh is an old word.

00:12:03.938 --> 00:12:07.550
As is the case with the book Futuh al-Buldan by al-Baladhuri.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.983
Futuh is always used in all Islamic sources.

00:12:10.983 --> 00:12:13.397
But the word occupation

00:12:13.397 --> 00:12:17.606
Another point, Abu Omar, that we should always keep in mind.

00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:20.747
And I am addressing this to the young people.

00:12:20.747 --> 00:12:26.031
Language is the key to understanding.

00:12:26.031 --> 00:12:29.330
And understanding is the key to acting and viewing life.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.833
If you don't pay close attention to the language, you will be lost.

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:40.037
Today, when we use the word occupation, for example,

00:12:40.037 --> 00:12:47.697
we think it is similar to other words like Futuh or colonialism.

00:12:47.697 --> 00:12:49.620
It's not.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.214
We employ occupation, such as the Israeli occupation.

00:12:53.214 --> 00:12:55.278
Why do we call it the Israeli occupation?

00:12:55.278 --> 00:13:00.066
Because occupation means removing the Palestinians and occupying their land.

00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:03.818
They take their heritage, steal their land,

00:13:03.818 --> 00:13:06.598
destroy their homes, and expel them.

00:13:06.598 --> 00:13:08.150
This is what an occupation is.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.071
They take your place.

00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:11.912
This is a kind of occupation.

00:13:11.912 --> 00:13:15.351
This is a heinous kind of occupation

00:13:15.351 --> 00:13:19.700
because it excludes indigenous citizens from their land.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.492
Like what happened in America, for example.

00:13:21.492 --> 00:13:27.441
They excluded all the so-called American Indians from their land

00:13:27.441 --> 00:13:30.729
and killed, scattered, and exterminated them, correct?

00:13:30.729 --> 00:13:38.103
There were 90 million American Indian citizens

00:13:38.103 --> 00:13:41.598
killed in European occupations.

00:13:41.598 --> 00:13:44.830
The Israeli occupation is trying to practice so-called genocide

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.350
against Palestinians in a slow and systematic way.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.601
This is a kind of occupation.

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:54.689
But there are other kinds of occupations that keep citizens,

00:13:54.689 --> 00:13:56.323
for example, Great Britain in India.

00:13:56.323 --> 00:13:59.522
Because they can't banish or kill all Indians.

00:13:59.522 --> 00:14:02.015
What do they do then?

00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:07.066
In Australia, America, and Israel

00:14:07.066 --> 00:14:11.890
they are trying to destroy the indigenous population.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.318
It is possible because their numbers are small.

00:14:15.318 --> 00:14:22.182
But they couldn't in India, of course, because the Indians were even more numerous than all Europeans.

00:14:22.182 --> 00:14:23.175
Correct?

00:14:23.175 --> 00:14:25.814
What did they do?

00:14:25.814 --> 00:14:32.554
If I can't kill you and erase you from the earth because I want to take your land,

00:14:32.554 --> 00:14:35.529
I will transform you to be like me.

00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:38.188
Because when you think like me,

00:14:38.188 --> 00:14:41.538
you are a part of me, and I can do whatever I want to you.

00:14:41.538 --> 00:14:44.841
Thus, I have the political authority,

00:14:44.841 --> 00:14:49.790
and you are my subjects

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.593
who are obedient

00:14:52.593 --> 00:15:01.658
and accept all the principles, political and social outlooks, and moral values of the ruler.

00:15:01.658 --> 00:15:05.357
So they became part of the population.

00:15:05.357 --> 00:15:13.648
But power, command, and control are in the hands of the colonists.

00:15:13.648 --> 00:15:24.465
Great Britain ruled India effectively for about 150 years

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:28.603
and for about 250 years before that, it wasn't as successful.

00:15:28.603 --> 00:15:30.531
They succeeded in the end.

00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:37.681
However, through this experience of 450 years,

00:15:37.681 --> 00:15:44.023
not a single Indian had sat in the English Parliament in London.

00:15:44.023 --> 00:15:45.270
Correct?

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.831
But the Indians, even today, if you have noticed when you talk with them,

00:15:49.831 --> 00:15:54.050
let us call them our Indian brothers, regardless of their religions,

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:59.222
many are influenced by and imbued with English civilization and mentality.

00:15:59.222 --> 00:16:05.027
I mean, some of them reached the point of absurdity in their imitation of the English.

00:16:05.027 --> 00:16:09.382
It causes some laughter, at least for me.

00:16:09.382 --> 00:16:12.102
They don't know that they have been colonized.

00:16:12.102 --> 00:16:14.312
This is modern colonialism.

00:16:14.312 --> 00:16:22.612
This is when the subjectivity of the colonized crystallizes into the colonizer's subjectivity.

00:16:22.612 --> 00:16:25.926
How about the new British Prime Minister?

00:16:25.926 --> 00:16:35.654
These are the effects of the numerous subsequent effects of colonization.

00:16:35.654 --> 00:16:43.284
England today has millions of Indians.

00:16:43.284 --> 00:16:49.166
This is something the British couldn't control.

00:16:49.166 --> 00:16:56.638
And since there are a lot of Indians in England now,

00:16:56.638 --> 00:17:00.900
You can see that some are very successful and wealthy

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.727
and they can attain what is called political power.

00:17:04.727 --> 00:17:08.160
Therefore, one of them made it successfully.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.141
Why is that?

00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:13.126
Because he has exploited these divisions in the rock

00:17:13.126 --> 00:17:17.208
and he was able to get this position.

00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:20.932
This is not because the British love Democracy

00:17:20.932 --> 00:17:25.840
or they're ready to accept all the results of Democracy.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.471
This is a major misconception.

00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:28.482
Why?

00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:33.281
Because Democracy allows for everything as long as it's democratic,

00:17:33.281 --> 00:17:36.211
and this is dictatorship.

00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:38.810
Because Western democracy

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.971
is a matter of Western political freedom.

00:17:41.971 --> 00:17:43.965
And this is another topic.

00:17:43.965 --> 00:17:46.961
If you want, we can discuss it in some detail later.

00:17:46.961 --> 00:17:48.254
(Okay.)

00:17:48.254 --> 00:17:51.772
Because it means that you have political freedom

00:17:51.772 --> 00:17:58.170
and this freedom has a certain meaning and is of a certain type.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:04.336
We are unaware of all the different types of freedom that human history has produced.

00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:09.765
We only know the political freedom that Western States have produced for us.

00:18:09.765 --> 00:18:12.710
I could ask you a question:

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.443
Other than the principle of freedom of Western democracy and liberalism,

00:18:17.443 --> 00:18:24.048
Could you sufficiently explain an example of another type of freedom?

00:18:24.048 --> 00:18:26.718
I always ask this question to my students.

00:18:26.718 --> 00:18:29.151
No one has been able to answer it.

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:30.197
No one?

00:18:30.197 --> 00:18:34.228
Why? This is because the history of freedom, which we don't practice today

00:18:34.228 --> 00:18:38.569
but mankind practiced in many forms before the 19th century,

00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:40.644
is dead.

00:18:40.644 --> 00:18:44.977
It was killed by Western freedom.

00:18:44.977 --> 00:18:48.014
We only know one type of freedom.

00:18:48.014 --> 00:18:52.920
And this one type is a political type but is essentially economical.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.016
It's not just political.

00:18:56.016 --> 00:18:59.912
When you go to vote in the elections,

00:18:59.912 --> 00:19:06.585
although it appears that way, it isn't a purely political act.

00:19:06.585 --> 00:19:09.119
It's an economical act as well.

00:19:26.343 --> 00:19:31.198
I would like to go back to the topics of occupation and definitions.

00:19:31.198 --> 00:19:39.276
You were saying that the British in India

00:19:39.276 --> 00:19:42.433
didn't expel them but asked them to be like the British.

00:19:42.433 --> 00:19:43.952
(Correct.)

00:19:43.952 --> 00:19:47.980
Isn't this the same as what happened in Futuh?

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:54.167
All the nations that joined the Islamic State

00:19:54.167 --> 00:19:57.287
became Arabic and Islamic.

00:19:57.287 --> 00:20:05.135
They did change their identity, language, and religion.

00:20:05.135 --> 00:20:07.555
Isn't that the same thing?

00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:12.554
No, it isn't. There is a big difference.

00:20:12.554 --> 00:20:19.411
First of all, and very few people know this,

00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:23.352
even in the fourth and fifth centuries AH

00:20:23.352 --> 00:20:26.297
Muslims were a minority in their State.

00:20:26.297 --> 00:20:29.605
- Were you aware of this before now?
- No.

00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:32.515
- Muslims were the minority back then?
- Yes.

00:20:32.515 --> 00:20:35.991
They were the minority, but they were the rulers.

00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:40.293
And their empire, assuming it's correct to call it that

00:20:40.293 --> 00:20:46.356
You noticed that I said their empire, but this is the wrong usage.

00:20:46.356 --> 00:20:53.335
Empire was not a term they used to describe their rule.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:56.724
They had a caliphate, or sultanate.

00:20:56.724 --> 00:21:01.616
I used the term empire because I'm still influenced by modern discourse.

00:21:01.616 --> 00:21:05.091
Aren't these different terms and nothing more?

00:21:05.091 --> 00:21:07.478
No, each one has its own meaning.

00:21:07.478 --> 00:21:11.362
The meaning determines the quantity and the quality, and the quality is very important

00:21:11.362 --> 00:21:14.598
Let's start with it.

00:21:14.598 --> 00:21:18.292
The first fact about Islamic history,

00:21:18.292 --> 00:21:23.668
and it started from the beginning

00:21:23.668 --> 00:21:28.645
Since the era of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him

00:21:28.645 --> 00:21:30.061
What did he say?

00:21:30.061 --> 00:21:32.420
He said: when you conquer a state,

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.621
leave them be.

00:21:35.621 --> 00:21:39.811
"You have your religion, and I have my religion." (The Holy Quran, 109:6)

00:21:39.811 --> 00:21:43.046
This was very clear.

00:21:43.046 --> 00:21:46.960
He did not even think about it because it was natural to him.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.761
This is how their mentality worked from the beginning.

00:21:49.761 --> 00:21:53.802
And the Holy Quran insisted on it.

00:21:53.802 --> 00:21:56.403
Leave them to worship what they want

00:21:56.403 --> 00:21:59.183
and give them their religious freedoms.

00:21:59.183 --> 00:22:08.292
Jews and Christians could get married, trade, and pray, almost doing whatever they wanted.

00:22:08.292 --> 00:22:13.436
According to their beliefs and religions.

00:22:13.436 --> 00:22:19.916
However, when you leave your home and are in a public space or on a shared street

00:22:19.916 --> 00:22:24.709
that have Muslims, Jews, Christians and others,

00:22:24.709 --> 00:22:31.004
You respect the law or the law of society in general,

00:22:31.004 --> 00:22:33.454
which is Islamic law, or Shari‘a.

00:22:33.454 --> 00:22:35.286
So you aren't allowed to sell alcohol.

00:22:35.286 --> 00:22:43.022
And you should not use interest when dealing with Muslims.

00:22:43.022 --> 00:22:47.277
The usury.

00:22:47.277 --> 00:22:49.665
The forbidden and haram things

00:22:49.665 --> 00:22:55.201
It is mainly alcohol and forbidden meat.

00:22:55.201 --> 00:23:00.388
And alcohol was always one of the big problems.

00:23:00.388 --> 00:23:03.011
Even in actual history.

00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:09.302
Not just in principles and jurisprudence.

00:23:09.302 --> 00:23:13.407
There were actually problems.

00:23:13.407 --> 00:23:16.201
Because alcohol was common even among the Arabs.

00:23:16.201 --> 00:23:18.703
It was causing a lot of problems.

00:23:18.703 --> 00:23:22.249
These are a few problems we need to avoid.

00:23:22.249 --> 00:23:30.689
They insisted on punishing anyone who committed these heinous acts.

00:23:30.689 --> 00:23:35.971
And they taught their children.

00:23:35.971 --> 00:23:38.038
And this is the most important thing.

00:23:38.038 --> 00:23:40.804
Another essential premise, and this one is of great importance,

00:23:40.804 --> 00:23:43.955
the Jews, Christians and other minorities

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:46.010
and in India later on,

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.977
this is when the Mughal state occupied India,

00:23:49.977 --> 00:23:57.844
and they stepped into the embrace of Islamic society or "Islamic Empire,"

00:23:57.844 --> 00:24:05.944
they have accepted followers of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and others.

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:10.319
There were 500–600 minorities in India.

00:24:10.319 --> 00:24:13.706
All of them came under Islamic rule.

00:24:13.706 --> 00:24:25.640
The Shari‘a that was applied to Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:30.312
now extends to almost all other non-Muslims.

00:24:30.312 --> 00:24:33.666
However, and this is a crucial point,

00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:36.665
the Jews, Christians and others

00:24:36.665 --> 00:24:41.838
they have raised and cared for their children

00:24:41.838 --> 00:24:44.870
on the values of

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.670
The Islamic?

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:51.085
No, it's based on the values of their religion.

00:24:51.085 --> 00:24:54.929
The Jews continued to be Jews.

00:24:54.929 --> 00:25:01.960
Not only that, but the Muslims insisted that everyone keep their religion.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.797
If you want to be a Jew, then do whatever you want to do as a Jew, and it's your right.

00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:11.336
They also say: You're from Ahl al-Dhimmah. But what does Dhimmah mean?

00:25:11.336 --> 00:25:14.122
Dhimmah means to be our responsibility.

00:25:14.122 --> 00:25:19.186
Muslims owe protection to Ahl al-Dhimmah since they paid their Jizya.

00:25:19.186 --> 00:25:22.398
They protect you on your religious conditions.

00:25:22.398 --> 00:25:25.995
The conditions are the laws of the book.

00:25:25.995 --> 00:25:32.478
If the book is Jewish or Christian, the laws of the book are always politically sacred.

00:25:32.478 --> 00:25:36.163
There is full respect for these minorities.

00:25:36.163 --> 00:25:41.768
Therefore, the Jewish identity and the Christian identity

00:25:41.768 --> 00:25:46.382
continued to have the same identity.

00:25:46.382 --> 00:25:50.917
Of course, as times change, many things change anyway.

00:25:50.917 --> 00:25:53.383
But these doctrines

00:25:53.383 --> 00:25:56.081
And Jewish practices, for example,

00:25:56.081 --> 00:25:58.203
I use Judaism as an example,

00:25:58.203 --> 00:26:00.701
it lasted over the centuries.

00:26:00.701 --> 00:26:04.643
This lasted until the establishment of the State of Israel.

00:26:04.643 --> 00:26:07.587
When it's all over, of course.

00:26:07.587 --> 00:26:10.465
The Jews left the Islamic states and went to Israel.

00:26:10.465 --> 00:26:15.598
And the modern state entered and dismantled Jewish and Islamic society.

00:26:15.598 --> 00:26:17.602
But this is a different story.

00:26:17.602 --> 00:26:20.446
However, what I'm trying to say

00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:24.496
is that the minorities lasted in Islam.

00:26:24.496 --> 00:26:28.138
I'm not referring to numerical minorities here

00:26:28.138 --> 00:26:31.764
but religious minorities in the sense that they are not the rulers.

00:26:31.764 --> 00:26:33.981
Such as Christianity and Judaism.

00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:44.426
They were able to continue to generate themselves throughout the ages.

00:26:44.426 --> 00:26:48.355
On their own terms and not on the conditions of the colonizer.

00:26:48.355 --> 00:26:51.230
Just look at the level of tolerance.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.220
and how much openness they have.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:27:00.812
I know Canada and have lived there for 24 years, and I'm very familiar with what they call multiculturalism.

00:27:00.812 --> 00:27:03.266
The whole thing is a joke.

00:27:03.266 --> 00:27:05.713
When you study Islamic history,

00:27:05.713 --> 00:27:09.538
and you see how the Muslims treated their minorities,

00:27:09.538 --> 00:27:18.021
and of course, we are only discussing how the colonizer alters subjectivity.

00:27:18.021 --> 00:27:21.262
But we could discuss it from other angles.

00:27:21.262 --> 00:27:27.149
For example, Jews and Christians in Islamic history up until the 20th century

00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:32.672
if look at Egypt and similar places, you have Christian and Jewish minorities

00:27:32.672 --> 00:27:35.370
and they are always at the forefront.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:41.356
They were doctors, lawyers, merchants, and members of the rich class.

00:27:41.356 --> 00:27:43.543
They had many privileges.

00:27:43.543 --> 00:27:48.083
And sometimes they had more privileges than Muslims in an unfair way.

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:54.286
Honestly, sometimes they even dominate.

00:27:54.286 --> 00:27:56.331
Yeah.

00:27:56.331 --> 00:27:59.071
The same is happening now in Indonesia.

00:27:59.071 --> 00:28:01.864
Indonesia is repeating the same experience.

00:28:01.864 --> 00:28:05.709
3% of Indonesians are Chinese.

00:28:05.709 --> 00:28:12.799
They hold 70% of Indonesia's natural resources and funds.

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:17.854
3% of the population

00:28:17.854 --> 00:28:23.093
holds 70% of the wealth of the people and the state.

00:28:23.093 --> 00:28:33.412
How do you read this tolerance in Islamic rule with non-Muslims

00:28:33.412 --> 00:28:39.162
while also in the same Islamic history, you find hostility that is happening a lot

00:28:39.162 --> 00:28:42.000
inside the Muslims and between them

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.793
with the different sects, or the one who has different ideas?

00:28:45.793 --> 00:28:49.530
History has a lot of examples of this.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.791
Of course, there were such things.

00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:55.378
For instance, I'll discuss the Crusader period.

00:28:55.378 --> 00:28:58.001
There was a lot of assault on Christians

00:28:58.001 --> 00:29:01.985
in what we call Syria today, primarily in Aleppo and Damascus.

00:29:01.985 --> 00:29:04.600
And some other villages

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:10.103
that surrounded the castles back in the day.

00:29:10.103 --> 00:29:14.430
In the past, the castle had villages around it.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:18.961
These have always been subject to violence.

00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:21.714
So, of course there was, but why?

00:29:21.714 --> 00:29:27.558
There was a big suspicion that the Christians in Damascus were helping the Crusaders.

00:29:27.558 --> 00:29:33.402
When there is persecution against a Christian or a Jew in Islamic history,

00:29:33.402 --> 00:29:42.179
it wasn't just natural puritanism that was indoctrinated into the Islamic mentality.

00:29:42.179 --> 00:29:45.077
It wasn't like that but there were always special circumstances

00:29:45.077 --> 00:29:48.501
which used to lead the ruler or the people

00:29:48.501 --> 00:29:54.267
to tighten the belt on these minorities.

00:29:54.267 --> 00:30:02.802
The Crusader period was undoubtedly a problem for Christians in Syria.

00:30:02.802 --> 00:30:07.861
I wasn't there, and I can't decide whether they were spies or not.

00:30:07.861 --> 00:30:09.547
This is normal.

00:30:09.547 --> 00:30:13.534
For example, if you look at America during World War II and what they did,

00:30:13.534 --> 00:30:17.418
they put all the Japanese in the concentration camps, as they call them.

00:30:17.418 --> 00:30:21.019
In fenced camps.

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:26.599
The Japanese, who were even born in America generations ago,

00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:28.933
and they were not Japanese other than in appearance.

00:30:28.933 --> 00:30:33.324
They put them all in these camps.

00:30:33.324 --> 00:30:37.143
But why? Because they doubted that they could help Japan.

00:30:37.143 --> 00:30:38.413
This is normal

00:30:38.413 --> 00:30:44.909
Despite its ugliness, this reaction could be

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:49.503
one of the things in life that are ugly and had to happen.

00:30:49.503 --> 00:30:55.674
As they say: When we are born,

00:30:55.674 --> 00:30:58.679
in the moment of childbirth

00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:00.695
in a very beautiful moment

00:31:00.695 --> 00:31:03.450
but we are born in blood.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:04.757
Correct?

00:31:04.757 --> 00:31:10.402
This is part of what it means to fight an enemy that has invaded your state

00:31:10.402 --> 00:31:13.723
and occupied your land, killed your people, and killed others.

00:31:13.723 --> 00:31:16.806
I mean, the Crusaders didn't only kill the Muslims

00:31:16.806 --> 00:31:19.919
but they killed the Christians in Jerusalem as well.

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:23.666
And in Constantine, before it was Istanbul,

00:31:23.666 --> 00:31:27.725
they invaded it and killed the Christian Byzantines

00:31:27.725 --> 00:31:30.000
because they weren't like them

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.841
They wanted to purify them

00:31:31.841 --> 00:31:33.248
and save their souls

00:31:33.248 --> 00:31:35.132
and help them reach salvation

00:31:35.132 --> 00:31:37.011
so they killed them.

00:31:37.011 --> 00:31:38.925
Okay, I want to go back to Shari‘a.

00:31:38.925 --> 00:31:41.514
In your book "Sharī'a"

00:31:41.514 --> 00:31:47.579
you said: in the first three centuries,

00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:54.083
the new religion has been able to produce a sophisticated legislative system.

00:31:54.083 --> 00:31:55.049
( True.)

00:31:55.049 --> 00:32:01.862
How was this legislative system formed since its inception in the era of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?

00:32:01.862 --> 00:32:07.919
If I may, let me start with an introduction.

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:13.588
Every historical vision is a discourse.

00:32:13.588 --> 00:32:18.836
I mean, when I say that Islamic history has developed and so on, this is a discourse.

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:25.802
This discourse becomes part of my intellectual components and, by extension, part of my personal components.

00:32:25.802 --> 00:32:31.480
Therefore, the discourse makes me who I am.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:38.146
Here, at least, I will only talk about two discourses.

00:32:38.146 --> 00:32:41.771
A discourse about the period of the emergence of Shari‘a

00:32:41.771 --> 00:32:45.499
to see the difference between them.

00:32:45.499 --> 00:32:49.644
Later, perhaps we will discuss the issues of Orientalism.

00:32:49.644 --> 00:32:55.180
It will be an introduction to this subsequent discussion.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.088
There is an Orientalist discourse that says

00:32:58.088 --> 00:33:00.730
that the Shari‘a was formed

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:07.924
after the Muslims invaded, conquered, and colonized other countries.

00:33:07.924 --> 00:33:11.841
And they came from Arabian Peninsula.

00:33:11.841 --> 00:33:15.299
A group of Bedouins that lacked everything.

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:19.108
They have nothing—no civilization or even thinking.

00:33:19.108 --> 00:33:24.687
All the orientalist views of the Hijaz people

00:33:24.687 --> 00:33:28.742
and even the whole southern section of the Peninsula

00:33:28.742 --> 00:33:30.538
the birthplace of Islam,

00:33:30.538 --> 00:33:32.680
or the middle south of it

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.276
they see them as barbaric tribal people.

00:33:37.276 --> 00:33:41.432
And what do they mean by tribal? This is another point we can study later.

00:33:41.432 --> 00:33:46.956
For them, tribal means against all the civilized values of today.

00:33:46.956 --> 00:33:49.483
Those tribals have nothing

00:33:49.483 --> 00:33:54.609
so they sent their violence-loving tribes

00:33:54.609 --> 00:33:57.722
to occupy the north, east, and west.

00:33:57.722 --> 00:34:01.148
And in the end, after they occupied these lands,

00:34:01.148 --> 00:34:05.929
they thought it was impossible to rule these lands since we have nothing.

00:34:05.929 --> 00:34:12.314
Let's plunder other nations wealth.

00:34:12.314 --> 00:34:17.479
Not only their money and land, but their cultural wealth as well.

00:34:17.479 --> 00:34:19.403
Including their laws.

00:34:19.403 --> 00:34:22.419
The Muslims came,

00:34:22.419 --> 00:34:24.619
and since they have nothing,

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:27.019
Those Arab savages

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:28.932
This is how the Orientalist view goes.

00:34:28.932 --> 00:34:31.670
I'm summarizing it for you.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.911
You may have to pay me for this

00:34:33.911 --> 00:34:37.718
because I'm summarizing about 200 books for you.

00:34:37.718 --> 00:34:40.253
The discourse

00:34:40.253 --> 00:34:42.958
of those 200 books

00:34:42.958 --> 00:34:47.428
can be summarized and boiled down to this view.

00:34:47.428 --> 00:34:49.883
I've written a lot about it, by the way.

00:34:49.883 --> 00:34:52.597
These aren't Impressions.

00:34:52.597 --> 00:34:55.997
It took me six years to study it.

00:34:55.997 --> 00:34:58.842
A large part of my writings

00:34:58.842 --> 00:35:02.487
is a response to the orientalists from this point.

00:35:02.487 --> 00:35:05.537
The point at which Shari‘a was established

00:35:05.537 --> 00:35:10.564
They say they took the Roman law.

00:35:10.564 --> 00:35:12.376
And Byzantine law.

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:15.102
And the law before it, which is the Greek law.

00:35:15.102 --> 00:35:17.847
And the Jewish Law.

00:35:17.847 --> 00:35:21.707
All of this is rather stolen, even though they don't say it that way.

00:35:21.707 --> 00:35:27.908
They say that it was "borrowed."

00:35:27.908 --> 00:35:28.739
Loaned?

00:35:28.739 --> 00:35:31.327
Or they call it "debt".

00:35:31.327 --> 00:35:33.462
For example, How do they say it in English?

00:35:33.462 --> 00:35:39.113
And this is the short version for the youth who are interested in these studies.

00:35:39.113 --> 00:35:43.344
They either call it "borrowings",

00:35:43.344 --> 00:35:45.766
this is like when you borrow something

00:35:45.766 --> 00:35:48.216
or they call it "debt".

00:35:48.216 --> 00:35:50.229
Either borrowing or debt.

00:35:50.229 --> 00:35:54.074
When they say: It is a debt, It means: Look at what they took from us.

00:35:54.074 --> 00:35:58.950
While with "borrowing", it means they took it from us.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:03.192
In the first one, there is a kind of guarantee that you must pay.

00:36:03.192 --> 00:36:07.962
In the second, they don't mind that it was taken from them.

00:36:07.962 --> 00:36:10.510
This is the Orientalist view.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.678
Is this the extremist view?

00:36:12.678 --> 00:36:15.980
No, this is the prevailing Orientalist view.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.260
And I say that even after all the writings that have been written against it

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:24.257
by a small number of people,

00:36:24.257 --> 00:36:26.784
It's still the most prevalent view.

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:32.930
Therefore, one of the great orientalists in Islamic law said:

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:36.788
When colonialism came in the 19th century,

00:36:36.788 --> 00:36:43.695
and just look at how their speeches about the first century and the 19th and 20th centuries have been the same.

00:36:43.695 --> 00:36:48.961
A casual reader might assume that this is a book specifically about the first century

00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:51.310
and it has nothing to do with the 20th century.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:54.698
But if you look at them all, you'll see the same discourse.

00:36:54.698 --> 00:36:58.152
You'll find someone like Joseph Schacht.

00:36:58.152 --> 00:37:03.304
He was the leading Western scholar on Islamic law

00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:04.987
What did he say?

00:37:04.987 --> 00:37:06.797
Listen to this,

00:37:06.797 --> 00:37:12.878
"You Muslims, have been suffering for centuries

00:37:12.878 --> 00:37:15.773
and those centuries are frozen

00:37:15.773 --> 00:37:17.950
and now you are in a predicament."

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.615
This speech was in the 19th century

00:37:20.615 --> 00:37:23.086
and the beginning of the 20th century.

00:37:23.086 --> 00:37:25.390
He continues: Your law has failed.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.328
Your Shari‘a has failed.

00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:32.017
You won't do anything that isn't familiar to you.

00:37:32.017 --> 00:37:35.542
When you started and established your law

00:37:35.542 --> 00:37:37.830
you borrowed Western law,

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.163
the Greek and Roman, and so on.

00:37:40.163 --> 00:37:42.947
Why don't you do it again?

00:37:42.947 --> 00:37:50.053
Because, and this is what the orientalist says, the Muslims have taken all these Western laws

00:37:50.053 --> 00:37:52.126
which are originally European.

00:37:52.126 --> 00:37:54.824
Notice how they exclude the Persian laws here,

00:37:54.824 --> 00:37:57.528
even though the Persians influenced Islam a lot.

00:37:57.528 --> 00:38:01.666
Because it's all the work of Orientalists, and thus all of it must be European.

00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:05.149
You borrowed all of these laws.

00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:07.112
And what did you do with it?

00:38:07.112 --> 00:38:09.279
You covered it with fabricated ahadith

00:38:09.279 --> 00:38:11.514
and with the Quran.

00:38:11.514 --> 00:38:18.019
Until recently, the prevalent Orientalist theory says

00:38:18.019 --> 00:38:24.106
that the Quran came to

00:38:24.106 --> 00:38:29.547
to sign the hadith as you would a contract.

00:38:29.547 --> 00:38:33.778
The Quran signs the Shari‘a

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:36.499
but only after the first 100 years of Hijrah.

00:38:36.499 --> 00:38:40.823
This means the Quran had no influence on Islam in the first century.

00:38:40.823 --> 00:38:44.579
The Quran came later, just to be the cover.

00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:48.131
The Orientalists use the word "Veneer" a lot.

00:38:48.131 --> 00:38:49.645
What is the veneer?

00:38:49.645 --> 00:38:53.282
When you bring some wood to make a table from it,

00:38:53.282 --> 00:38:58.390
it is usually a type of pressed wood of low quality,

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.976
so what you do is put a layer on it,

00:39:01.976 --> 00:39:04.120
this layer was cut from a natural tree,

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.304
and this layer has a thickness of one millimeter.

00:39:07.304 --> 00:39:11.188
A layer of unprocessed wood that you stick to it to cover it.

00:39:11.188 --> 00:39:16.266
Now the table looks like it was made of all natural wood.

00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:20.201
This is what the Muslims did, according to Orientalism.

00:39:20.201 --> 00:39:22.895
They brought the Quran and fabricated the ahadith.

00:39:22.895 --> 00:39:25.748
That's why the major theory of Orientalism

00:39:25.748 --> 00:39:29.097
is that the Prophet's Hadith is all fabricated and fraudulent.

00:39:29.097 --> 00:39:32.051
A massive scheme of deceit.

00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:35.166
I mean, when you read Orientalism, you will come to one conclusion.

00:39:35.166 --> 00:39:38.777
It's that the orientalists say, In a literary and academic way,

00:39:38.777 --> 00:39:42.954
that these Muslims are the biggest liars in the world.

00:39:42.954 --> 00:39:45.693
All of their civilization is based on deceit and lies.

00:39:45.693 --> 00:39:49.781
This is because they fabricated all of Prophet's ahadith.

00:39:49.781 --> 00:39:54.706
About 5000 hadith that are hasan (good and authentic) and applied

00:39:54.706 --> 00:40:00.057
and has an effective role in the making of Shari‘a

00:40:00.057 --> 00:40:04.621
and other 700,000 hadith

00:40:04.621 --> 00:40:10.425
that are not considered

00:40:10.425 --> 00:40:12.850
at least in Shari‘a,

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:16.576
all of them, including the hasan ones, are lies.

00:40:16.576 --> 00:40:19.082
They actually have a motto:

00:40:19.082 --> 00:40:28.177
Every hadith is fabricated until proven otherwise.

00:40:28.177 --> 00:40:31.046
Ignác Goldziher wrote this motto.

00:40:31.046 --> 00:40:37.461
He was a Jewish orientalist from Hungary.

00:40:37.461 --> 00:40:43.012
Other prominent orientalists continued his work,

00:40:43.012 --> 00:40:45.593
like Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje from the Netherlands,

00:40:45.593 --> 00:40:48.522
but it was primarily continued by Schacht from Germany

00:40:48.522 --> 00:40:50.765
This is their code.

00:40:50.765 --> 00:40:55.089
Every hadith is false until proven otherwise.

00:40:55.089 --> 00:41:00.370
This is the Orientalist view of how Shari‘a was formulated.

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:03.400
In the 20th century,

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:09.917
they said: You have done it before. Just take the European laws and say that they are Islamic.

00:41:09.917 --> 00:41:12.060
And cover it however you like.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.559
You can say that Shura is Democracy.

00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:19.451
And a democracy in the way we want it.

00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:21.836
Shura becomes a democracy.

00:41:21.836 --> 00:41:28.042
And since Shura has a basis in the old Islamic political discourse,

00:41:28.042 --> 00:41:34.365
then this discourse becomes applicable to neoliberalism.

00:41:34.365 --> 00:41:36.374
Is this the Western academic discourse?

00:41:36.374 --> 00:41:37.517
(Yes, it is.)

00:41:37.517 --> 00:41:38.710
The academic?

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:43.546
If you wish, I can provide you with references.

00:41:43.546 --> 00:41:45.391
Okay.

00:41:45.391 --> 00:41:47.414
This is the Orientalist view

00:41:47.414 --> 00:41:49.894
But what had really happened?

00:41:49.894 --> 00:41:51.589
It's completely different.

00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:52.750
(Let's have it.)

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:54.612
The first thing,

00:41:54.612 --> 00:41:58.106
If you read it

00:41:58.106 --> 00:42:04.678
like anyone who has a balanced mind,

00:42:04.678 --> 00:42:09.817
not programmed or directed toward a certain goal

00:42:09.817 --> 00:42:11.767
unlike the colonial mind,

00:42:11.767 --> 00:42:14.118
if we read Islamic sources, we'll know

00:42:14.118 --> 00:42:17.437
We know that from the first day the Holy Quran was revealed,

00:42:17.437 --> 00:42:21.364
the Quran has a significant influence on Muslims

00:42:21.364 --> 00:42:23.477
unlike anything else

00:42:23.477 --> 00:42:25.136
even in all of human history.

00:42:25.136 --> 00:42:30.195
I don't know of a single book that has influenced people's minds like the Quran.

00:42:30.195 --> 00:42:32.223
This was the first thing.

00:42:32.223 --> 00:42:35.326
And as proven very recently,

00:42:35.326 --> 00:42:41.248
after the Prophet's companions died,

00:42:41.248 --> 00:42:46.165
the Muslims asked immediately what they should do in such a case.

00:42:46.165 --> 00:42:48.959
They had an issue now, so how did they solve it?

00:42:48.959 --> 00:42:51.421
They asked: What does the Quran tell us?

00:42:51.421 --> 00:42:53.630
So they did this from the beginning.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.615
But all of this needs study.

00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:58.627
The Quran is not a law.

00:42:58.627 --> 00:43:02.187
The Quran is a book of guidance.

00:43:02.187 --> 00:43:06.609
Shari‘a, as it became later, is one thing, and the Quran is another.

00:43:06.609 --> 00:43:12.670
The Quran is the basis of Shari‘a, and it is the basis of everything else.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.256
What is Shari‘a?

00:43:14.256 --> 00:43:17.625
Shari‘a is the linguistic interpretation.

00:43:17.625 --> 00:43:26.530
Ibn Idris al-Shafi'i did a significant project, may God have mercy on him.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:34.092
The project of Ibn Idris Al-Shafi’i was purely linguistic one.

00:43:34.092 --> 00:43:37.424
Purely legitimate linguist.

00:43:37.424 --> 00:43:39.311
His book of Al-Risala,

00:43:39.311 --> 00:43:42.854
and somewhat in the book Kitab al-Umm,

00:43:42.854 --> 00:43:51.171
but mainly in Al-Risala, his project was: how do we understand what Allah wants for us?

00:43:51.171 --> 00:43:52.906
How can we know that?

00:43:52.906 --> 00:43:56.850
We need signs, evidence, and so on.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:01.912
We need the rope to hold so we can pull and reach to

00:44:01.912 --> 00:44:08.414
the best way to reach and figure out knowledge about what Allah wants from us?

00:44:08.414 --> 00:44:13.504
The answer is to imitate the wisdom of Allah.

00:44:13.504 --> 00:44:18.108
I watched a few of your episodes, and you asked one of your guests:

00:44:18.108 --> 00:44:21.075
What is different about Islamic science?

00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:23.366
Islamic science in general

00:44:23.366 --> 00:44:25.830
when Muslims have studied astronomy,

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.502
and mathematics

00:44:27.502 --> 00:44:29.934
and when Ibn al-Haytham studied the eye

00:44:29.934 --> 00:44:31.729
and everything else

00:44:31.729 --> 00:44:33.563
including law,

00:44:33.563 --> 00:44:38.545
it's all about trying to understand how the mind of Allah works.

00:44:38.545 --> 00:44:44.218
When Allah created the world,

00:44:44.218 --> 00:44:48.194
He created it with justice and wisdom.

00:44:48.194 --> 00:44:49.766
Justice.

00:44:49.766 --> 00:44:54.813
The whole point is to understand what Allah's justice is.

00:44:54.813 --> 00:44:57.880
Even when we studied the planets,

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.345
we didn't study it to occupy it, as we do now.

00:45:01.345 --> 00:45:04.237
We are trying to find a replacement planet.

00:45:04.237 --> 00:45:07.506
Like a bottle of Coca-Cola, you drink it and throw it away.

00:45:07.506 --> 00:45:11.999
We're doing to Earth the same thing that we did to that bottle.

00:45:11.999 --> 00:45:14.002
You drink it and throw it away

00:45:14.002 --> 00:45:17.546
Without responsibility, foresight, or conscience, you are destroying the earth.

00:45:17.546 --> 00:45:19.920
And you are happy about yourself.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.469
We do the same thing with planets.

00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:27.421
What is the goal of the agency today?

00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:31.314
It's to locate a planet similar to Earth.

00:45:31.314 --> 00:45:38.418
The solution is to find a planet as far from the sun as we are.

00:45:38.418 --> 00:45:44.203
There exist optimal conditions, or those required for survival.

00:45:44.203 --> 00:45:46.968
Just look at the wisdom behind it.

00:45:46.968 --> 00:45:51.846
If you are looking for another planet, that's fine.

00:45:51.846 --> 00:45:54.988
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:45:54.988 --> 00:46:00.534
They want another planet because they're destroying this one.

00:46:00.534 --> 00:46:02.555
We see it every day.

00:46:02.555 --> 00:46:08.213
Thus, the wealthy and powerful travel by spaceship to be kings there.

00:46:08.213 --> 00:46:10.801
The rest stay here to suffer

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:15.203
from the destruction that is going to happen.

00:46:15.203 --> 00:46:16.744
Is this what's happening right now?

00:46:16.744 --> 00:46:18.918
(Oh, yes, it's happening already.)

00:46:18.918 --> 00:46:21.570
You're referring to Mars voyage?
Of course.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.278
This is what is different about their science.

00:46:25.278 --> 00:46:29.825
Islamic science is completely different in its philosophy from modern science.

00:46:29.825 --> 00:46:34.368
It was superior to all other civilizations in the world

00:46:34.368 --> 00:46:38.711
and even matched Western science until the eighteenth century.

00:46:38.711 --> 00:46:39.955
Absolutely.

00:46:39.955 --> 00:46:42.128
Mathematics and astronomical sciences,

00:46:42.128 --> 00:46:44.690
the study of the eyes,

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:46.771
and blood circulation

00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:50.417
until the beginning of the eighteenth century,

00:46:50.417 --> 00:46:56.295
the Muslim doctors used to laugh at the Europeans' work.

00:46:56.295 --> 00:47:01.494
They say: What are they doing? They must be centuries behind.

00:47:01.494 --> 00:47:07.591
We will look into why there is a new and strong science in the West

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:10.783
by the 19th century and at the end of the 18th century.

00:47:10.783 --> 00:47:13.950
Because it has absolutely nothing to do with civilizational progress.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.710
Nothing at all?

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:21.678
On the contrary, it has a full connection to destruction and murder.

00:47:21.678 --> 00:47:23.633
(There is no god except Allah.)

00:47:23.633 --> 00:47:27.990
For example, the history of medicine is a history of violence from its beginning.

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:31.890
You are using the computer you are holding, right?

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.235
Do you know how this came to be?

00:47:34.235 --> 00:47:40.419
It's from the war between Germany and the Western European alliance.

00:47:40.419 --> 00:47:42.984
They needed a computer

00:47:42.984 --> 00:47:47.506
to address the problems that the Germans caused them.

00:47:47.506 --> 00:47:51.842
The Germans were directing their submarines to attack ships coming from America.

00:47:51.842 --> 00:47:55.447
The ships were sailing to help the British.

00:47:55.447 --> 00:48:02.134
The Germans attacked them, and the British were unable to decode the instructions.

00:48:02.134 --> 00:48:08.461
If they did, they could redirect their ships or maybe attack the submarines head-on.

00:48:08.461 --> 00:48:11.182
So they created a computer.

00:48:11.182 --> 00:48:14.630
It's the same computer all of us are using today.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:19.524
They created it specifically for this.

00:48:19.524 --> 00:48:23.435
Therefore, they can win the war against Germany.

00:48:23.435 --> 00:48:25.376
But where is the problem?

00:48:25.376 --> 00:48:29.341
Since there there was a need that required an invention,

00:48:29.341 --> 00:48:32.446
and that invention has become useful in other aspects today.

00:48:32.446 --> 00:48:35.872
That is a very good question.

00:48:35.872 --> 00:48:41.630
This makes scientific inventions and scientific developments

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:45.524
are not for serving humanity.

00:48:45.524 --> 00:48:47.667
Since it has a history of violence,

00:48:47.667 --> 00:48:50.553
this means that it is connected to something we can't see yet.

00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:55.553
For example, when I say that all the vaccinations

00:48:55.553 --> 00:49:01.591
or the first Industrial vaccinations in human history.

00:49:01.591 --> 00:49:06.659
Because, as you know, the native Americans had herbal vaccinations.

00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:09.889
It is different and not as good as what we have now.

00:49:09.889 --> 00:49:11.519
They've had it before.

00:49:11.519 --> 00:49:18.200
But the vaccinations against typhoid, cholera, tetanus, and others

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.045
Do you know where it came from?

00:49:20.045 --> 00:49:25.794
All of this was invented in Europe so that they could send their soldiers

00:49:25.794 --> 00:49:30.502
to Niger River in Africa

00:49:30.502 --> 00:49:33.334
Because the only way to take over Africa was through the Niger River.

00:49:33.334 --> 00:49:35.050
They couldn't occupy it.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.045
Because they send their ships and soldiers,

00:49:37.045 --> 00:49:40.618
and in a week or two, they all die from diseases

00:49:40.618 --> 00:49:44.684
from stinging insects, flies, etc.

00:49:44.684 --> 00:49:48.323
It caused typhoid and other diseases.

00:49:48.323 --> 00:49:52.316
They found the solution in vaccination.

00:49:52.316 --> 00:49:54.906
Now, what does this mean?

00:49:54.906 --> 00:49:58.706
This means you just discovered one and need to do more research.

00:49:58.706 --> 00:50:03.366
Did you know medical history was linked this closely to violence?

00:50:03.366 --> 00:50:04.926
Very few knew that.

00:50:04.926 --> 00:50:08.796
And for the vaccines, I will leave a link in the episode description

00:50:08.796 --> 00:50:12.684
to a video explaining some of what happened.

00:50:12.684 --> 00:50:15.776
They even experimented on people in Africa.

00:50:15.776 --> 00:50:16.752
(Yes.)

00:50:16.752 --> 00:50:18.241
Using violence.

00:50:18.241 --> 00:50:24.643
You could research the relationship between medicine and the economy.

00:50:24.643 --> 00:50:28.342
Colonization wasn't a charity case.

00:50:28.342 --> 00:50:31.747
They couldn't colonize without reason. No.

00:50:31.747 --> 00:50:38.411
The first main goal in the beginning was to take the wealth of other peoples.

00:50:38.411 --> 00:50:42.687
They went and stole all the gold and silver from America.

00:50:42.687 --> 00:50:45.947
From South America, mainly, but also from North America.

00:50:45.947 --> 00:50:49.461
They shipped them to Europe and used their new wealth to do a variety of things.

00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:56.715
They went to India and stole its spices and gold,

00:50:56.715 --> 00:51:00.719
and gemstones like rubies and others, and India was full of them.

00:51:00.719 --> 00:51:03.192
They plundered Egypt as well.

00:51:03.192 --> 00:51:05.316
We all know this story.

00:51:05.316 --> 00:51:12.381
But we don't know that medicine, which we're proud of today

00:51:12.381 --> 00:51:16.212
and say everyone has a treatment option with modern medicine,

00:51:16.212 --> 00:51:19.994
All of this is fully and absolutely tied

00:51:19.994 --> 00:51:22.836
to the history of capitalism,

00:51:22.836 --> 00:51:25.550
which is a big part of the history of colonialism,

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:28.293
which is a big part of the history of violence

00:51:28.293 --> 00:51:31.367
and the development of previously unknown destructive weapons,

00:51:31.367 --> 00:51:35.848
and tied to a large part of the European mind that operates in this manner.

00:51:35.848 --> 00:51:38.753
I wrote a book called "Restating Orientalism".

00:51:38.753 --> 00:51:47.676
I claimed in it that there is no truth produced by the human hand.

00:51:47.676 --> 00:51:51.914
Like this Central Park here in New York.

00:51:51.914 --> 00:51:58.433
There is no tree here that isn't implanted artificially.

00:51:58.433 --> 00:52:01.831
I mean, there is no tree there that was kept from before.

00:52:01.831 --> 00:52:04.665
This is man-made.

00:52:04.665 --> 00:52:16.244
There is no human creation unless the mind imposes it on us.

00:52:16.244 --> 00:52:21.888
In other words, the things we do are a result of how we think.

00:52:21.888 --> 00:52:25.009
Our thinking is the most important thing.

00:52:25.009 --> 00:52:28.645
If you think in a certain way, you do it that way.

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:33.491
For example, If you gave a kitchen knife to a good, honest cook,

00:52:33.491 --> 00:52:35.837
he'll make the best meal

00:52:35.837 --> 00:52:39.026
and will present to you with the best reception

00:52:39.026 --> 00:52:43.491
and you act like loving brothers, and so on.

00:52:43.491 --> 00:52:46.165
He was holding a knife in his hand.

00:52:46.165 --> 00:52:49.618
If you give it to a thief who breaks homes,

00:52:49.618 --> 00:52:52.794
he'll kill you, steal your home, and leave.

00:52:52.794 --> 00:52:55.408
The criminal does different things with it.

00:52:55.408 --> 00:52:57.482
The knife is unimportant here.

00:52:57.482 --> 00:52:59.247
It's only a tool.

00:52:59.247 --> 00:53:03.695
The responsible for the decision is the mind

00:53:03.695 --> 00:53:06.996
and the way of thinking.

00:53:06.996 --> 00:53:13.545
Europe and all its thinking since the beginning of its history,

00:53:13.545 --> 00:53:16.620
although it is long and complicated

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.373
and it dates back to the Barbarian ages

00:53:20.373 --> 00:53:24.535
when these barbarian clans and tribes migrated

00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:28.150
from Northern Europe to Spain and Germany

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:34.835
and later were called the Visigoths, Germanic, Franks, and others.

00:53:34.835 --> 00:53:37.872
These are all from the northern peoples.

00:53:37.872 --> 00:53:40.810
They invaded Europe and filled it with their people.

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:43.211
So they had a certain way of thinking.

00:53:43.211 --> 00:53:46.932
Their God is a god of war, and this is how it started.

00:53:46.932 --> 00:53:49.376
Has it ended or not?

00:53:49.376 --> 00:53:50.377
(No, it didn't.)

00:53:50.377 --> 00:53:52.354
So it still governs their thoughts.

00:53:52.354 --> 00:53:57.166
It started to evolve and take different forms

00:53:57.166 --> 00:54:03.128
but the content remained largely the same.

00:54:03.128 --> 00:54:11.528
For example, the Chinese had gunpowder 1500 years ago.

00:54:11.528 --> 00:54:16.299
The first people to invent the gun were the Chinese.

00:54:16.299 --> 00:54:22.114
The first people who stuffed the gun with gunpowder were the Chinese.

00:54:22.114 --> 00:54:25.475
Well, why didn't the Chinese occupy the rest of the world?

00:54:25.475 --> 00:54:29.913
In 1422, they built a fleet of a thousand ships.

00:54:29.913 --> 00:54:31.818
They were frightening.

00:54:31.818 --> 00:54:35.971
Each one was the size of 4–5 European ships at that time.

00:54:35.971 --> 00:54:39.513
They sailed for Africa.

00:54:39.513 --> 00:54:42.188
And visited Africa.

00:54:42.188 --> 00:54:48.679
And they fought some criminal pirates at sea.

00:54:48.679 --> 00:54:51.410
They gathered plants.

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:56.343
They brought representatives of the sultans and kings with them

00:54:56.343 --> 00:55:00.138
to introduce them to the Chinese emperor.

00:55:00.138 --> 00:55:01.606
And they went back.

00:55:01.606 --> 00:55:07.037
They returned with the elephants, giraffes, and other beautiful animals,

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:09.284
and with gorgeous plants

00:55:09.284 --> 00:55:12.109
And some ambassadors from different states.

00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:17.999
And they left their fleet in the ports of China to rot.

00:55:17.999 --> 00:55:20.108
What did Europe do?

00:55:20.108 --> 00:55:22.574
They discovered Chinese gunpowder

00:55:22.574 --> 00:55:27.098
and they discovered how to make cannons as well.

00:55:27.098 --> 00:55:29.380
And just like that,

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.210
with no time wasted,

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:37.002
they built the deadliest ships in human history.

00:55:37.002 --> 00:55:39.573
Their ships were relatively small

00:55:39.573 --> 00:55:42.358
and they utilized gun ports

00:55:42.358 --> 00:55:49.021
that have the capability to penetrate a much larger ship and sink it

00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:53.719
So neither Muslims, Chinese, nor anyone else could stop them.

00:55:53.719 --> 00:55:59.186
When Portuguese and Spanish sailed down to the Indian ocean,

00:55:59.186 --> 00:56:01.230
no one could resist them.

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.746
That's why they controlled the Indian Sea.

00:56:03.746 --> 00:56:06.437
The pattern of trade has changed completely.

00:56:06.437 --> 00:56:12.310
The pattern of trade was prevalent between Muslims, Chinese, Indians, and others.

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:16.405
By the way, most of the customs were according to Shari‘a.

00:56:16.405 --> 00:56:21.467
Even the Chinese followed the law of the sea as dictated by Shari‘a.

00:56:21.467 --> 00:56:24.056
It's not that it's inescapable.

00:56:24.056 --> 00:56:29.661
It is because it existed before and it was customary, so they took it and used it.

00:56:29.661 --> 00:56:32.269
This is all broken now.

00:56:32.269 --> 00:56:36.820
And the Portuguese came and said: If you want to pass, you have to pay us money.

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:41.347
But if there is gold in your cargo, whether you pay or not, we will take you and your gold.

00:56:41.347 --> 00:56:43.990
You are our captive, and your gold is ours.

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:47.966
We would build palaces with it in Portugal, France, and England.

00:56:47.966 --> 00:56:50.741
Didn't the Muslims have the same goals?

00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:55.452
They had a desire to expand, and they did so.

00:56:55.452 --> 00:57:01.310
To the point where Harun al-Rashid said to a cloud: Pour it wherever you want, the taxes from that are mine.

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:05.205
It's true, and this is how occupying other people works, but there are limits.

00:57:05.205 --> 00:57:10.545
If you want, we can discuss why it was like that, specifically after the 17th century.

00:57:10.545 --> 00:57:15.548
Europe was the exception in human history.

00:57:15.548 --> 00:57:18.688
This is what we should understand.

00:57:18.688 --> 00:57:23.220
We have been living as cohesive and political societies

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:27.088
as small cities or city-states

00:57:27.088 --> 00:57:29.218
for 7000 years.

00:57:29.218 --> 00:57:31.908
Our history today

00:57:31.908 --> 00:57:35.941
or the known written history,

00:57:35.941 --> 00:57:39.740
More or less, we are somewhat aware of it.

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:42.667
Rather, we know a lot about where it stopped and when.

00:57:42.667 --> 00:57:45.564
It goes back to five or six thousand years ago.

00:57:45.564 --> 00:57:49.108
In human history, this has been written about, and we know it.

00:57:49.108 --> 00:57:53.433
The only exception to this history is Europe.

00:57:53.433 --> 00:57:58.985
If it were to be illustrated on a diagram,

00:57:58.985 --> 00:58:01.643
you begin from the corner

00:58:01.643 --> 00:58:04.897
the line will go smoothly

00:58:04.897 --> 00:58:07.525
barely above the lower line

00:58:07.525 --> 00:58:11.224
and suddenly there will be a jump

00:58:11.224 --> 00:58:14.859
this jump takes about 2% of the line length

00:58:14.859 --> 00:58:19.257
But whether up or down, it depends on how you view European history.

00:58:19.257 --> 00:58:22.450
If you see it as Wael Hallaq did, then it will go down.

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:28.830
But if you see it according to who sold their souls and minds to the colonization, it will go up.

00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:31.364
Can we know why it went down based on Wael's view?

00:58:31.364 --> 00:58:34.477
Because most people see it go up.

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:36.991
This episode will have digressions

00:58:36.991 --> 00:58:40.057
and these digressions are fantastic.

00:58:40.057 --> 00:58:41.696
- (We can go back if you want to.)
- Sure.

00:58:41.696 --> 00:58:43.956
Then let's go back to the evolution of Shari‘a.

00:58:43.956 --> 00:58:46.295
Could guide us to how it happened.

00:58:46.295 --> 00:58:47.297
Great.

00:58:47.297 --> 00:58:49.543
Thank you for taking us back.

00:58:49.543 --> 00:58:51.075
No problem.

00:58:51.075 --> 00:59:01.921
I can say that the biggest and most important act

00:59:01.921 --> 00:59:05.445
that happened in the history of Islam to establish Shari‘a

00:59:05.445 --> 00:59:10.173
was in the era of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him.

00:59:10.173 --> 00:59:18.458
Omar played a frightening role in the creation of Islam.

00:59:18.458 --> 00:59:19.710
Why is that?

00:59:19.721 --> 00:59:23.050
Of course, he established the Diwans and many other acts.

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:26.438
But half of the Diwans were originally Persian.

00:59:26.438 --> 00:59:32.830
He utilized them with superb intelligence.

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:35.996
Of course, this is clear to all.

00:59:35.996 --> 00:59:38.420
But what did he really do?

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:43.262
Since the beginning, he ordered that wherever there is an Islamic gathering,

00:59:43.262 --> 00:59:47.091
and usually those tribes that participated in the invasion

00:59:47.091 --> 00:59:49.677
were in conflict with each other.

00:59:49.677 --> 00:59:55.731
When they arrived in Iraq and even in Egypt, in Fustat,

00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:59.121
they started to fight with each other.

00:59:59.121 --> 01:00:01.815
They all participated in occupying Egypt,

01:00:01.815 --> 01:00:05.900
but when they were done, they started disagreeing on some matters.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:11.178
They brought with them their tribal history from Arabia.

01:00:11.178 --> 01:00:13.153
Disagreements started to happen.

01:00:13.153 --> 01:00:15.121
Omar didn't want that.

01:00:15.121 --> 01:00:17.198
There are other places to conquer.

01:00:17.198 --> 01:00:19.458
There is a state to be established.

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:21.790
An empire.

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:23.616
So, what did he do?

01:00:23.616 --> 01:00:28.479
Any place that has an Islamic gathering should have a mosque built immediately.

01:00:28.479 --> 01:00:30.480
What is a mosque?

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.281
We hear and read about it a lot in history.

01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:37.592
They say: He built mosques on the frontiers.

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:39.672
But what does this really mean?

01:00:39.672 --> 01:00:44.167
The mosque is not just a building.

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:47.072
The first step to having a mosque is the building.

01:00:47.072 --> 01:00:48.545
A small step.

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:50.291
However, what happens inside the mosque?

01:00:50.291 --> 01:00:53.127
What are the practices in the mosque?

01:00:53.127 --> 01:00:57.876
The mosque has an Imam and a muezzin.

01:00:57.876 --> 01:01:01.409
Although it was small, the mosque was present.

01:01:01.409 --> 01:01:04.854
They started reciting stories.

01:01:04.854 --> 01:01:09.181
The stories contained a lot of the Prophet's Hadiths

01:01:09.181 --> 01:01:12.732
and many of the Prophet's commands and actions,

01:01:12.732 --> 01:01:16.844
including what he did and didn't do and what he forbade or didn't forbid.

01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:20.593
It included a lot of al-Athar.

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:29.043
Al-Athar are the sayings and the language that are a kind of source for our actions.

01:01:29.043 --> 01:01:32.830
Or it could be Eibrah (a cautionary lesson or story that serves to warn).

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:35.768
The Eibrah guides the actions.

01:01:35.768 --> 01:01:38.231
This is why it's called that.

01:01:38.231 --> 01:01:42.524
When he built the mosques,

01:01:42.524 --> 01:01:52.659
and this is 10 to 15 years after the death of the Prophet,

01:01:52.659 --> 01:01:58.068
people started going to the mosque

01:01:58.068 --> 01:02:01.501
Those occupiers who went to the mosques

01:02:01.501 --> 01:02:05.866
their leaders were, without a doubt, Muslims to the fullest.

01:02:05.866 --> 01:02:08.200
They were loyal to the cause.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.777
While those tribes were apostate a few years ago.

01:02:11.777 --> 01:02:15.733
Abu Bakr, who ruled before Omar, was fighting them.

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:20.616
They took part in the conquests as well.

01:02:20.616 --> 01:02:25.746
They were only halfway committed to Islam.

01:02:25.746 --> 01:02:31.839
We don't assume that all Muslims who conquered

01:02:31.839 --> 01:02:36.878
 understood Islam perfectly on a personal level.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.851
Some of them wanted other things.

01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:41.566
However, the majority of them and all the leaders were pure.

01:02:41.566 --> 01:02:43.433
The leadership was pure.

01:02:43.433 --> 01:02:45.553
This is why they conquered.

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:53.470
That is why 2000 of them can crush 20,000 of their enemies.

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:57.203
Because they were very committed to the cause.

01:02:57.203 --> 01:03:00.810
And they had children.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:03.819
They sent their children to the mosque.

01:03:03.819 --> 01:03:06.800
And this generation, the generation of these children,

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.886
the descendants of those who conquered lands for Islam.

01:03:12.886 --> 01:03:19.057
It is the generation that started to produce people who not only have faith in Islam

01:03:19.057 --> 01:03:27.710
but also have a commitment to what Islam requires as a civilization

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:31.089
and a personal and social concept.

01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:37.388
Islam is not only about the two Shahada.

01:03:37.388 --> 01:03:41.996
They are not enough to make you a true Muslim.

01:03:41.996 --> 01:03:46.321
They do introduce you to Islam and let you in Islam.

01:03:46.321 --> 01:03:49.451
However, when you enter through the house door,

01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:52.622
you don't stop at the door and call it home.

01:03:52.622 --> 01:03:56.267
You don't put your bed at the house door.

01:03:56.267 --> 01:04:01.110
You have to live long enough in it before it becomes part of you.

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:06.373
Islam is about forming subjectivity, which is the most important thing.

01:04:06.373 --> 01:04:08.913
My dear friend, we have to understand one thing.

01:04:08.913 --> 01:04:12.882
There is no understanding of any phenomenon today,

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:17.208
a phenomenon that is related to human formation,

01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:20.850
unless it goes back to self-formation.

01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:26.191
We have to understand who we are and who the rest are.

01:04:26.191 --> 01:04:31.804
Why is your program so successful?

01:04:31.804 --> 01:04:35.584
I've been thinking about it for a few weeks.

01:04:35.584 --> 01:04:41.040
If I take you off your show and put someone else on it,

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.230
The show will change completely. But why?

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:45.681
Because of your subjectivity.

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:47.737
The way you think

01:04:47.737 --> 01:04:49.728
The way you ask your guest

01:04:49.728 --> 01:04:51.422
The way you treat your guest

01:04:51.422 --> 01:04:56.485
They bring everything.

01:04:56.485 --> 01:05:02.830
It is hard sometimes to understand what exactly has to do with self-formation.

01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:07.174
But all together, it becomes a tremendous success. All praise to Allah.

01:05:07.174 --> 01:05:12.780
Subjectivity is when someone says: I'm not comfortable with him; I prefer another one.

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.880
But what does it mean, and why?

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.842
You aren't uncomfortable with him for no reason.

01:05:17.842 --> 01:05:20.640
But you are uncomfortable with his subjectivity.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.938
Subjectivity is everything.

01:05:22.938 --> 01:05:25.191
And there was an Islamic subjectivity.

01:05:25.191 --> 01:05:28.031
The tribes that participated in the conquests,

01:05:28.031 --> 01:05:30.556
their subjectivity was not purely Islamic.

01:05:30.556 --> 01:05:35.166
Once the first generation was created and grew up in mosques,

01:05:35.166 --> 01:05:41.206
Islamic subjectivity started to form as if almost everything was there.

01:05:41.206 --> 01:05:46.048
Where did jurisprudence originate?

01:05:46.048 --> 01:05:54.753
This is an undeniable truth that cannot be downgraded below that of the pyramids.

01:05:54.753 --> 01:05:58.214
The pyramids, wonders of Egypt, stand tall and high.

01:05:58.214 --> 01:06:01.137
This is also one of the most important facts.

01:06:01.137 --> 01:06:11.524
This is due to jurisprudence and the law,

01:06:11.524 --> 01:06:15.914
and it was called Shari‘a rather than law, which is what we call it now,

01:06:15.914 --> 01:06:20.840
The Law of the Political Apparatus and the Law of the Social Apparatus,

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:27.922
they were created entirely by simple members of society, sometimes they were even poor.

01:06:27.922 --> 01:06:36.962
When a judge from Egypt or Damascus was ruling between the people,

01:06:36.962 --> 01:06:39.803
or he was judging the people,

01:06:39.803 --> 01:06:44.509
certain cases were sometimes incomprehensible to him

01:06:44.509 --> 01:06:47.063
So he writes to Omar, for example,.

01:06:47.063 --> 01:06:56.247
He says: I have a difficult problem with a case. Please guide us.

01:06:56.247 --> 01:07:03.844
Omar says in most cases: You should strive to deduce the best opinion (Ijtihad).

01:07:03.844 --> 01:07:08.327
Nowadays, if I didn't know what the law is,

01:07:08.327 --> 01:07:13.574
and I write to the director of a legal office in the state,

01:07:13.574 --> 01:07:17.041
do you think they'll tell me to do ijtihad?

01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:18.464
In this age?

01:07:18.464 --> 01:07:22.226
The state has a law, and it always does.

01:07:22.226 --> 01:07:24.285
The state is the one that sets the law.

01:07:24.285 --> 01:07:28.584
No one can ever challenge that.

01:07:28.584 --> 01:07:31.751
But the Caliph did not legislate.

01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:33.546
Omar, for instance,

01:07:33.546 --> 01:07:36.695
he had legal stances

01:07:36.695 --> 01:07:40.270
because he was a companion and not because he was a caliph

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:41.919
What's the difference?

01:07:41.919 --> 01:07:45.861
The companion is a jurist.

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:53.251
He understands how the Prophet would have solved the problem.

01:07:53.251 --> 01:07:56.145
He knows from his experience.

01:07:56.145 --> 01:07:59.181
A companion of the Prophet is a person who was with him.

01:07:59.181 --> 01:08:05.109
The companionship was not only on a social level.

01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:07.522
The social aspect is what comes to mind first.

01:08:07.522 --> 01:08:10.717
In Islam, the issue of Prophet's companions

01:08:10.717 --> 01:08:14.864
is a purely epistemological issue.

01:08:14.864 --> 01:08:19.855
This means the companion knows about what the Prophet wants,

01:08:19.855 --> 01:08:22.654
and the prophet knows what Allah wants,

01:08:22.654 --> 01:08:26.596
in a way that is the closest thing between any human being and another

01:08:26.596 --> 01:08:29.825
or between any human being and any other divine power.

01:08:29.825 --> 01:08:33.108
Omar was a companion.

01:08:33.108 --> 01:08:35.926
Ibn Mas'ud, for example, was even closer than Omar.

01:08:35.926 --> 01:08:42.215
One of the greatest lawmen was Ibn Mas'ud,

01:08:42.215 --> 01:08:45.384
if it were possible to call it that today.

01:08:45.384 --> 01:08:48.125
He is the greatest lawman in the history of Islam.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:51.025
How did they come to that?

01:08:51.025 --> 01:08:56.868
They were so close to the prophet that they almost knew what the prophet knew.

01:08:56.868 --> 01:08:59.018
It's a matter of knowing.

01:08:59.018 --> 01:09:02.890
The issue is not that he sat with the Prophet and drank coffee

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:05.355
and they became friends.

01:09:05.355 --> 01:09:09.251
Omar and Abu Bakr used to go with the prophet and eat breakfast together,

01:09:09.251 --> 01:09:13.929
and they visit even Jewish schools

01:09:13.929 --> 01:09:16.060
and listen to what they teach there.

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:19.172
They were open to others, and they did a lot of things together.

01:09:19.172 --> 01:09:24.179
But this in itself is not a social relationship; it is an epistemological relationship.

01:09:24.179 --> 01:09:28.857
The new generation that grew up in mosques and the teachings of mosques

01:09:28.857 --> 01:09:31.114
and what was happening in the mosques

01:09:31.114 --> 01:09:33.376
They were the jurists.

01:09:33.376 --> 01:09:36.176
The jurisprudence became in the hands of the people

01:09:36.176 --> 01:09:38.640
and not in the hands of politics.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.342
And from here, we begin to understand the vast difference

01:09:41.342 --> 01:09:46.529
between the concept of Islamic political structure

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:50.702
and the Western political structure today.

01:09:50.702 --> 01:09:56.322
For example, if someone had a problem

01:09:56.322 --> 01:10:02.667
and he wants to consult someone,

01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:08.185
he would go to ordinary people who specialize in Jurisprudence.

01:10:08.185 --> 01:10:10.353
You can find other stories like this.

01:10:10.353 --> 01:10:14.377
There was a leather seller

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:19.110
as you know, like in shoes, clothing, etc.

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:25.866
In front of his shop in the market, he teaches his students jurisprudence.

01:10:25.866 --> 01:10:29.230
We are talking about approximately the year 80 Hijri.

01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:32.831
They were sitting in a circle around him to learn about jurisprudence.

01:10:32.831 --> 01:10:38.189
And someone interrupted his lesson

01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:41.292
because he wanted to buy a leather belt.

01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:46.373
So the teacher stood up, sold the belt, and took the money,

01:10:46.373 --> 01:10:49.281
and went back to sit with his students to continue his lesson.

01:10:49.281 --> 01:10:51.830
This is in the Medina only, or in all cities?

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:56.462
This story is either from Basra or Kufa; I can't remember.

01:10:56.462 --> 01:11:04.037
Because they were some of the first centers for the emergence of al-Fiqh (jurisprudence).

01:11:04.037 --> 01:11:07.930
The first formation of jurisprudence has begun.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:12.748
It was an answer to the question: What do we do in these cases?

01:11:12.748 --> 01:11:17.809
It came from these people, who are among the social average.

01:11:17.809 --> 01:11:22.161
They were not either military or political leaders.

01:11:22.161 --> 01:11:24.488
People like you and me, as they say.

01:11:24.488 --> 01:11:32.743
Some of them are small traders, or even rich ones in a few instances.

01:11:32.743 --> 01:11:37.221
I mean, they were ordinary people who lived a normal life.

01:11:37.221 --> 01:11:41.202
May I inquire about something?

01:11:41.202 --> 01:11:50.746
This could create a dilemma

01:11:50.746 --> 01:11:57.721
What if someone issued a fatwa that was contrary to what Islam agrees upon?

01:11:57.721 --> 01:12:00.040
Is there someone to correct him?

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.830
It depends.

01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:05.724
Is someone going to stop him and tell him that he is wrong?

01:12:05.724 --> 01:12:09.441
Yes, there were, of course, debates about the opinions.

01:12:09.441 --> 01:12:14.636
I mean, this is a statement, and when one comes out with a statement, then it is just a statement.

01:12:14.636 --> 01:12:18.716
You'll find that Omar bin Al-Khattab appoints the Wali (prefect).

01:12:18.716 --> 01:12:21.030
A wali of Iraq, for example.

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:22.630
No.

01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:26.210
But he is the one who sent him there.

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:28.054
- (As a judge?)
- Yes, a judge.

01:12:28.054 --> 01:12:30.510
- (Yes, that correct)
- I, as a representative of the state, appointed him.

01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:34.286
As a ruler and a wali, not as a government.

01:12:34.286 --> 01:12:38.470
A little while ago, you said

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:41.446
that this happens to simple people.

01:12:41.446 --> 01:12:52.632
But in fact, the leader, Caliph, Commander of the faithful, or whatever, is the one who appointed the wali, or judge.

01:12:52.632 --> 01:12:58.158
I realize that, but what I am talking about is something else entirely.

01:12:58.158 --> 01:13:06.326
Of course, judges are part of the legal system.

01:13:06.326 --> 01:13:11.220
The one responsible for it was the Caliph in the beginning.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.569
And then the Sultan centuries later.

01:13:14.569 --> 01:13:20.115
Of course, the judge must have cleverness and experience in many things.

01:13:20.115 --> 01:13:24.271
examining social norms, for example, in addition to laws.

01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:27.914
He must be knowledgeable about Shari‘a and many other things.

01:13:27.914 --> 01:13:32.124
But we assume that this judge was appointed after training.

01:13:32.124 --> 01:13:36.349
I mean, someone must have shown him how to do these things, right?

01:13:36.349 --> 01:13:39.351
But how al-Fiqh was established is another matter.

01:13:39.351 --> 01:13:43.872
The judiciary is not directly involved in how jurisprudence is written in books.

01:13:43.872 --> 01:13:48.287
It was connected in that the author served as a judge.

01:13:48.287 --> 01:13:49.704
But sometimes it's not like that.

01:13:49.704 --> 01:13:55.374
We know that there are some jurists who refuse to work in the judiciary.

01:13:55.374 --> 01:13:57.116
A rejection based on principle.

01:13:57.116 --> 01:14:03.334
They devoted themselves to classification and writing books.

01:14:03.334 --> 01:14:07.744
And to education as elders in schools.

01:14:07.744 --> 01:14:16.889
It was mainly about teaching jurisprudence and al-Ifta

01:14:16.889 --> 01:14:20.538
You have four jobs in the judiciary that are very important.

01:14:20.538 --> 01:14:22.781
Which are judiciary, fatwa,

01:14:22.781 --> 01:14:26.987
classification or writing books, which is also a special art,

01:14:26.987 --> 01:14:31.119
and sheikhdom, which is the education of the new generation.

01:14:31.119 --> 01:14:34.191
There are many of them who refuse to become judges.

01:14:34.191 --> 01:14:37.310
The state, at that time,

01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:43.123
It's responsible for the judiciary only and not al-Ifta or education.
- (Exactly.)

01:14:43.123 --> 01:14:47.496
The judge applies the jurisprudence that was produced

01:14:47.496 --> 01:14:52.915
by so-called early people of faith.

01:14:52.915 --> 01:14:56.046
Because it started with faith.

01:14:56.046 --> 01:15:00.781
They believed in Islam in such a way that they entered into it in spirit and body.

01:15:00.781 --> 01:15:02.981
This is the reason.

01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:05.364
They entered into it in spirit and body.

01:15:05.364 --> 01:15:07.275
This made them wonder,

01:15:07.275 --> 01:15:09.700
what if we wanted to eat or drink something,

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.412
or if a mouse falls into the oil, etc.

01:15:12.412 --> 01:15:14.461
All these issues, what are we going to do about it.

01:15:14.461 --> 01:15:17.508
They started to answer these questions.

01:15:17.508 --> 01:15:20.308
And they came forward and said, I think it's like this.

01:15:20.308 --> 01:15:24.615
I am a jurist myself, and I practice my own opinions according to my own diligence.

01:15:24.615 --> 01:15:29.115
And if you want to take it, go ahead; if not, don't. You are free to do what you want.

01:15:29.115 --> 01:15:30.991
Another jurist did the same thing.

01:15:30.991 --> 01:15:35.908
And then it evolved into the schools of jurisprudence.

01:15:35.908 --> 01:15:38.578
which later became known as madhhabs.

01:15:38.578 --> 01:15:42.216
The very important thing here is that we understand,

01:15:42.216 --> 01:15:50.788
and I'm going back to the Orientalist discourse that we talked about a little while ago.

01:15:50.788 --> 01:15:59.311
When they occupied the lands of the Levantine, Persian, and so on.

01:15:59.311 --> 01:16:06.077
Of course, there was a civilization in Syria, the Byzantine civilization.

01:16:06.077 --> 01:16:09.027
In the East, it was the Persian civilization.

01:16:09.027 --> 01:16:12.744
They were very impressive.

01:16:12.744 --> 01:16:16.606
However, these new believers

01:16:16.606 --> 01:16:21.628
They took what they wanted and refused what they didn't want.

01:16:21.628 --> 01:16:27.764
They weren't like the colonized people of today in the Islamic world and elsewhere.

01:16:27.764 --> 01:16:31.986
They are forced to take it.

01:16:31.986 --> 01:16:39.216
But back then, they took it from a position of strength.

01:16:39.216 --> 01:16:43.612
Ok in the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphate,

01:16:43.612 --> 01:16:49.136
were the jurists the most influential on Shari‘a?

01:16:49.136 --> 01:16:51.018
In the Prophet's era?

01:16:51.018 --> 01:16:52.314
(No, in the era of the Caliphate.)

01:16:52.314 --> 01:16:54.953
During the reign of the first Caliphate?

01:16:54.953 --> 01:16:56.797
Yes, in the era of Abu Bakr and Omar.

01:16:56.797 --> 01:17:01.793
In the era of Abu Bakr and Omar, al-Fiqh had not yet been established.

01:17:01.793 --> 01:17:07.366
There were some institutions, like Diwans.

01:17:07.366 --> 01:17:11.587
Diwans are part of Jurisprudence.

01:17:11.587 --> 01:17:16.261
It's true that it came from Persia

01:17:16.261 --> 01:17:19.195
but mostly and not entirely

01:17:19.195 --> 01:17:22.587
because the Diwans evolved later.

01:17:22.587 --> 01:17:28.062
And there are things in it that the Persians did not know before.

01:17:28.062 --> 01:17:34.120
At the beginning, in the era of Omar, they were mostly Persian.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:40.892
And in the end, it became part of the jurisprudential specifications.

01:17:40.892 --> 01:17:45.393
For example, all the books of al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya by al-Mawardi

01:17:45.393 --> 01:17:47.375
and Abu Ya'la ibn al-Farra'

01:17:47.375 --> 01:17:50.647
and Ibn Jama'ah, Ibn Taymiyyah, and others,

01:17:50.647 --> 01:17:55.916
they all say that Diwans are a section of Shari‘a specifications.

01:17:55.916 --> 01:18:00.628
But there was not yet the generation I am talking about.

01:18:00.628 --> 01:18:04.827
They are still trying to find their way.

01:18:04.827 --> 01:18:09.414
The first generation of jurists started

01:18:09.414 --> 01:18:14.142
under the first period of the Umayyad state.

01:18:14.142 --> 01:18:17.035
Before I get to the Umayyad state,

01:18:17.035 --> 01:18:19.959
I want to talk about Orientalists.

01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:29.453
Don't you agree that it's normal to take from other civilizations

01:18:29.453 --> 01:18:31.378
to form your legislation?

01:18:31.378 --> 01:18:33.750
Diwans are from Persia

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:35.680
and other things you took from other civilizations.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.631
Where is the problem? Maybe they are right?

01:18:37.631 --> 01:18:39.148
No doubt.

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:45.501
Muslims were among the most skilled people

01:18:45.501 --> 01:18:50.042
to open their minds to all their neighbors.

01:18:50.042 --> 01:18:56.127
They went to India and brought a lot from there.

01:18:56.127 --> 01:19:00.182
The same is true for Persia, Greece, and others.

01:19:00.182 --> 01:19:01.520
Based on Shari‘a?

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.334
No, but everything.

01:19:03.334 --> 01:19:07.010
Why did I say everything?

01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:10.998
When you said Shari‘a, Shari‘a had the principles of jurisprudence.

01:19:10.998 --> 01:19:13.038
Well, the principles of jurisprudence have logic.

01:19:13.038 --> 01:19:18.137
Aristotle and his logic went into the principles of jurisprudence.

01:19:18.137 --> 01:19:20.881
This means that it's in the Shari‘a.

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:24.029
And at the same time, Kalam had logic.

01:19:24.029 --> 01:19:25.610
And so on.

01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:28.554
The division of sciences in Islam

01:19:28.554 --> 01:19:31.592
are often artificial divisions.

01:19:31.592 --> 01:19:35.864
This is due to the extensive connections between the Islamic sciences.

01:19:35.864 --> 01:19:39.523
To the extent that when a science is developed dramatically

01:19:39.523 --> 01:19:41.858
and if the same happened to another science

01:19:41.858 --> 01:19:44.374
It's like two trees that have intertwined.

01:19:44.374 --> 01:19:46.472
They are nourished by the same land.

01:19:46.472 --> 01:19:48.554
They even communicate with each other.

01:19:48.554 --> 01:19:51.731
We know that trees talk to each other, even below the ground.

01:19:51.731 --> 01:19:53.457
It's the same thing.

01:19:53.457 --> 01:19:56.876
Islam

01:19:56.876 --> 01:19:59.740
Was there any issue with this?

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:02.830
No, because Islam was including them from a position of power.

01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:05.143
They can include whatever they want.

01:20:05.143 --> 01:20:12.895
If modern terminology is appropriate, Islam was the imperialist state.

01:20:12.895 --> 01:20:16.846
They can take what they want and leave out what they don't.

01:20:16.846 --> 01:20:19.548
Sometimes one takes and the other doesn't.

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.797
For example,

01:20:21.797 --> 01:20:25.721
Ibn Hazm, like al-Ghazali, used logic.

01:20:25.721 --> 01:20:28.985
By the way, Ibn Hazm started his project before al-Ghazali.

01:20:28.985 --> 01:20:31.957
Contrary to today's prevailing concept.

01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:34.651
But al-Ghazali undoubtedly had the biggest effect

01:20:34.651 --> 01:20:39.758
But historically, Ibn Hazm preceded and began before Al-Ghazali.

01:20:39.758 --> 01:20:42.335
When Al-Ghazali included logic,

01:20:42.335 --> 01:20:46.347
Ibn Taymiyyah came and told him to wait a little because there were some issues.

01:20:46.347 --> 01:20:50.207
I don't think you fully understand what you are doing.

01:20:50.207 --> 01:20:52.100
You're a genius, no doubt,

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:55.774
but there are problems with logic.

01:20:55.774 --> 01:20:57.756
You thought logic was innocent

01:20:57.756 --> 01:21:00.058
and it's just a thinking tool.

01:21:00.058 --> 01:21:02.857
No, logic is extremely complicated.

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:07.126
Logic ends in metaphysics.

01:21:07.126 --> 01:21:13.908
If you correctly understood all the ramifications of logic,

01:21:13.908 --> 01:21:16.126
logic will lead to metaphysics.

01:21:16.126 --> 01:21:18.120
The Greek metaphysics,

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:22.985
and both of al-Ghazali and Ibn Taymiyyah agreed on this that it's mostly corrupt.

01:21:22.985 --> 01:21:25.014
This means that there is something wrong with logic.

01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:28.274
For that, he wrote al-Radd ala al-Mantiqiyyin (The Refutation of the Logicians).

01:21:28.274 --> 01:21:31.492
It takes 550 pages in today's publishing.

01:21:31.492 --> 01:21:36.227
Even when al-Suyuti tried, he reduced it to about 150–200 pages.

01:21:36.227 --> 01:21:40.002
It's an abridgement of Ibn Taymiyya’s refutation of logic only, not the rest.

01:21:40.002 --> 01:21:43.879
This is a book I translated into English.

01:21:43.879 --> 01:21:49.919
There were conflicts—professional conflicts—and not in the bad sense.

01:21:49.919 --> 01:21:56.023
But there was a great Intellectual and civilized dynamic in Islam

01:21:56.023 --> 01:21:59.094
They accepted and rejected a lot of things.

01:21:59.094 --> 01:22:01.148
For example, If you take the principles of jurisprudence (Usul Al-Fiqh),

01:22:01.148 --> 01:22:05.929
And the principles of jurisprudence are full of materials that came from many sides.

01:22:05.929 --> 01:22:10.222
But other than the introductions to some of the principles of jurisprudence,

01:22:10.222 --> 01:22:17.111
in the analogical reasoning (Al-Qiyas)

01:22:17.111 --> 01:22:19.455
It's called al-qiyas al-burhani.

01:22:19.455 --> 01:22:22.978
But than the burhani type,

01:22:22.978 --> 01:22:25.545
If you know principles of jurisprudence very well

01:22:25.545 --> 01:22:28.632
to the point that you know its precise entries,

01:22:28.632 --> 01:22:31.339
you would be able to smell the food

01:22:31.339 --> 01:22:35.394
and you'll know that, for example, there is turmeric

01:22:35.394 --> 01:22:40.763
or even mahleb or others.

01:22:40.763 --> 01:22:43.823
Even though you don't see it,

01:22:43.823 --> 01:22:48.989
but you smell it, you barely taste it, and it's definitely there.

01:22:48.989 --> 01:22:54.700
When you read about Greek and Indian scientists,

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:57.944
you'll find shared opinions.

01:22:57.944 --> 01:23:01.145
This is because they have taken it from them.

01:23:01.145 --> 01:23:05.146
Let me just say this as sequel to this discussion,

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.248
Because it is extremely important.

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:13.689
Muslims today are open to very large Western influences.

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:16.182
But there is a huge difference.

01:23:16.182 --> 01:23:20.900
Today, Muslims are taking from the West from a position of weakness, not strength.

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:23.791
This makes a significant difference.

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:27.851
We have discussed a part of the Rashidun Caliphate.

01:23:27.851 --> 01:23:31.398
The Umayyad Caliphate and its beginning were different.

01:23:31.398 --> 01:23:36.585
Many historians say that it is the beginning of

01:23:36.585 --> 01:23:40.976
I mean that the Rashidun Caliphate is an era different than the Umayyad state era.

01:23:40.976 --> 01:23:47.769
Did this shift affect Islamic law and legislation?

01:23:47.769 --> 01:23:51.508
A good question.

01:23:51.508 --> 01:23:59.033
First, let's take a small look at Orientalism and Islamic history itself.

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:01.430
There is a historical problem.

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:06.842
It is because of the Abbasid dawa

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:11.106
and their revolution against the Umayyad.

01:24:11.106 --> 01:24:13.742
And the way they crushed the Umayyad.

01:24:13.742 --> 01:24:21.223
It created a discourse in Islamic history

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:26.368
which was adopted by new historians, including orientalists.

01:24:26.368 --> 01:24:32.784
The Umayyad state, because of Muawiyah and the initial wars, is a bad state,

01:24:32.784 --> 01:24:35.722
and that they have done terrible things

01:24:35.722 --> 01:24:38.264
while the Abbasids came to fix things.

01:24:38.264 --> 01:24:41.396
Of course, this is wrong.

01:24:41.396 --> 01:24:49.193
The Abbasids have caliphs whose records are not very good.

01:24:49.193 --> 01:24:52.678
Political rule is always like that.

01:24:52.678 --> 01:24:55.229
Take a look at the history of America and its presidents.

01:24:55.229 --> 01:25:00.268
How many of them are corrupt and have done terrible things?

01:25:00.268 --> 01:25:02.652
This is how politics are.

01:25:02.652 --> 01:25:07.675
The political field extends between good and corruption.

01:25:07.675 --> 01:25:10.434
And it leans more toward corruption.

01:25:10.434 --> 01:25:18.468
Politics always requires a lot of immoral acts.

01:25:18.468 --> 01:25:22.904
To judge the Umayyads, we must take into consideration

01:25:22.904 --> 01:25:26.330
that they ruled, and they were rulers like any other,

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:28.755
and they have to be measured by the same standard.

01:25:28.755 --> 01:25:30.322
This was number one.

01:25:30.322 --> 01:25:33.282
Number two: the Abbasid propaganda against them affected them a lot

01:25:33.282 --> 01:25:37.750
to the point where they appear negatively in Islamic history.

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:43.674
Shari‘a was primarily established by the Umayyads.

01:25:43.674 --> 01:25:44.767
Yes, of course.

01:25:44.767 --> 01:25:48.032
However, it's not only due to their encouragement

01:25:48.032 --> 01:25:55.847
but there was a way of thinking that was recognized, normal, and customary

01:25:55.847 --> 01:25:57.559
which required

01:25:57.559 --> 01:26:00.056
and this builds on what we previously said

01:26:00.056 --> 01:26:04.278
which required individual scholars

01:26:04.278 --> 01:26:09.900
who can create jurisprudence and the building of Shari‘a

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:13.332
which means in our modern language

01:26:13.332 --> 01:26:20.085
that the state and the Islamic empire did not interfere

01:26:20.085 --> 01:26:26.654
in the establishment of any department or any part of the legislative authority.

01:26:26.654 --> 01:26:31.161
The legislative authority in Islam was a civilization in itself.

01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:33.485
They are the scholars, the Shari‘a,

01:26:33.485 --> 01:26:36.638
and the civilization they spread across.

01:26:36.638 --> 01:26:42.060
And it's not just as strong as the legislative authority of today,

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:44.712
which are the parliaments and so on,

01:26:44.712 --> 01:26:47.200
but Shari‘a was a civilization.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.927
Shari‘a is the legislative authority at the same time.

01:26:49.927 --> 01:26:54.190
I'll give you a simple example to help you understand what we are talking about.

01:26:54.190 --> 01:26:59.560
Today, If you want to serve in the state,

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.087
you should go to law schools and study books that teach the state's law.

01:27:04.087 --> 01:27:06.943
The state will tell you what these laws are.

01:27:06.943 --> 01:27:09.762
You must become a servant of the state

01:27:09.762 --> 01:27:13.243
in the individual, personal, and even subjective sense

01:27:13.243 --> 01:27:17.976
to fill this job.

01:27:17.976 --> 01:27:19.712
To do this job.

01:27:19.712 --> 01:27:22.623
However, throughout Islamic history,

01:27:22.623 --> 01:27:28.372
and until the last day there ever was a caliphate or sultan in Islam,

01:27:28.372 --> 01:27:31.882
who Ataturk eliminated in Turkey,

01:27:31.882 --> 01:27:35.366
it was always that the Caliph and the Caliph's men,

01:27:35.366 --> 01:27:37.350
and the children of the Caliph's men,

01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:40.047
and the women of the children of the Caliph's men,

01:27:40.047 --> 01:27:47.972
and all the crew that was called the royal family in today's terminology,

01:27:47.972 --> 01:27:58.871
they were studying and absorbing the Shari‘a's civilization in society.

01:27:58.871 --> 01:28:03.042
Who taught the children of the caliphs and sultans?

01:28:03.042 --> 01:28:04.769
The scholars.

01:28:04.769 --> 01:28:06.349
What do they teach them?

01:28:06.349 --> 01:28:11.820
Quran, Sunnah, Hadith, Islamic history, literature, etc.

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:17.412
Shari‘a was the teacher of the sultans.

01:28:17.412 --> 01:28:24.721
The house of the sultan or caliph did not decide on laws that the people must follow.

01:28:24.721 --> 01:28:26.566
As we do today.

01:28:26.566 --> 01:28:29.097
We have a ruling class.

01:28:29.097 --> 01:28:35.948
The wealthy and corporations in America decide who the rulers are,

01:28:35.948 --> 01:28:39.318
and the people will follow them wherever they tell them to go, as simple as that.

01:28:39.318 --> 01:28:43.650
The books of Noam Chomsky are very important on this subject.

01:28:43.650 --> 01:28:46.585
Like his book, Manufacturing Consent.

01:28:46.585 --> 01:29:00.282
Shari‘a was in full control of the legislative authority.

01:29:00.282 --> 01:29:06.350
This is the framework from which Shari‘a emerged in the Umayyad State.

01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:10.458
The legislative authority was established

01:29:10.458 --> 01:29:18.395
and it provided the judiciary authority with people to carry out these tasks,

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:20.085
which are the judges.

01:29:20.085 --> 01:29:22.606
Without any interference.

01:29:22.606 --> 01:29:25.049
The state did not interfere with it.

01:29:25.049 --> 01:29:28.247
Because this was a socio-religious phenomenon.

01:29:28.247 --> 01:29:29.843
It wasn't a political phenomenon.

01:29:29.843 --> 01:29:37.133
How can we interpret the issue of the creation of the Quran

01:29:37.133 --> 01:29:39.088
with Ahmad ibn Hanbal and his imprisonment?

01:29:39.088 --> 01:29:48.361
How do you compare this with the sultan or caliph, who had an opinion on the law?

01:29:48.361 --> 01:29:50.593
This was called mihna (ordeal).

01:29:50.593 --> 01:29:57.360
Mihna was a desperate attempt by some of the Abbasid caliphs

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.857
who thought they could own all the land.

01:30:02.857 --> 01:30:08.256
And the mihna itself was not about Shari‘a.

01:30:08.256 --> 01:30:15.197
Shari‘a was not the subject of discussion in that ordeal.

01:30:15.197 --> 01:30:19.754
Rather, it was about Aqaʾid (Islamic creeds) and the fundamentals of the religion.

01:30:19.754 --> 01:30:22.288
This was the ordeal of the Quranic createdness.

01:30:22.288 --> 01:30:23.862
(How about Ibn Taymiyyah?)

01:30:23.862 --> 01:30:25.283
You mean Ibn Hanbal.

01:30:25.283 --> 01:30:28.654
I meant that Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned for a jurisprudential case.

01:30:28.654 --> 01:30:32.830
Yes, he was imprisoned for that, but not Ibn Hanbal.

01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:37.267
Ibn Taymiyyah's life is similar to that of Suhrawardi.

01:30:37.267 --> 01:30:39.040
The Murdered Master.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.212
You could be imprisoned for a reason that,

01:30:43.212 --> 01:30:48.376
and of course, Ibn Taymiyyah was an immensely great man,

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:51.873
but I'm going to give an example of the situation

01:30:51.873 --> 01:30:56.255
How does the state catch one of the mafia bosses today?

01:30:56.255 --> 01:30:58.135
Even though he's a killer

01:30:58.135 --> 01:30:59.718
still, you can't hold anything against them

01:30:59.718 --> 01:31:03.923
So they catch them with tax-income crimes.

01:31:03.923 --> 01:31:09.183
Ibn Taymiyyah had many enemies for different reasons

01:31:09.183 --> 01:31:13.385
Ibn Taymiyyah was outspoken and strongly expressed his views.

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:15.671
Like Ibn Abd al-Salam.

01:31:15.671 --> 01:31:17.490
And he insults the Sultan,

01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:22.433
although he was friends with some great Mamluks.

01:31:22.433 --> 01:31:29.009
Ibn Taymiyyah had a somewhat strong personality.

01:31:29.009 --> 01:31:33.867
Sometimes he used to say things that raised many political enemies.

01:31:33.867 --> 01:31:36.820
But when they try to judge him with anything,

01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:39.550
and he was a part of a long and wide progress,

01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:46.030
They won't isolate all the other problems and judge him in this one thing

01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:49.001
No. There were a lot of complications.

01:31:49.001 --> 01:31:53.016
Al-Hallaj was killed for a reason

01:31:53.016 --> 01:31:57.872
other than the one for which he was being tried.

01:31:57.872 --> 01:32:05.100
He fell into a situation where it allowed the minister to end him.

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:08.039
They had other reasons.

01:32:08.039 --> 01:32:10.870
They apprehended him for a minor claim and murdered him.

01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:18.641
You don't see that in all the states of Umayyad, Abbasid, and Ottoman

01:32:18.641 --> 01:32:21.018
there was no interference at all?

01:32:21.018 --> 01:32:26.652
Shari‘a prevailed as the supreme master over the sultans.

01:32:26.652 --> 01:32:28.951
This is also a very firm point.

01:32:28.951 --> 01:32:35.177
Shari‘a is the one that decided what the political structures were

01:32:35.177 --> 01:32:38.190
and governance in Islam as well.

01:32:38.190 --> 01:32:45.493
You said: Sufism is the overall explanation of Shari‘a.

01:32:45.493 --> 01:32:51.310
also: Islam relies on two dimensions, Sufism and Shari‘a.

01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:53.703
What do you mean by Sufism?

01:32:53.703 --> 01:33:03.956
Sufism is the care of soul-body.

01:33:03.956 --> 01:33:07.212
You add a dash between soul and body.

01:33:07.212 --> 01:33:09.334
They are considered one word.

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:14.222
The soul-body is there to educate the legitimate personality.

01:33:14.222 --> 01:33:20.292
Notice that Shari‘a started with some principles of Sufism.

01:33:20.292 --> 01:33:22.045
If look at Sufism,

01:33:22.045 --> 01:33:25.794
for example, fasting was in the Shari‘a from the beginning

01:33:25.794 --> 01:33:29.049
Not just Shari‘a, but since the inception of Islam.

01:33:29.049 --> 01:33:35.182
It is in many verses in the Holy Quran.

01:33:35.182 --> 01:33:39.743
It's also one of the five Pillars of Islam.

01:33:39.743 --> 01:33:42.272
What is the meaning of fasting?

01:33:42.272 --> 01:33:53.790
Today, we haven't started to understand 0.001% of what fasting and hunger mean

01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:56.447
in educating human subjectivity.

01:33:56.447 --> 01:33:58.305
There is a lot of work.

01:33:58.305 --> 01:34:03.708
I have students that I try to guide to study the meaning of fasting and hunger.

01:34:03.708 --> 01:34:09.326
And how they relate to creating a unique subjectivity.

01:34:09.326 --> 01:34:11.345
It's very important.

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:15.929
What is special about Sufism is that

01:34:15.929 --> 01:34:21.474
it takes humility, fasting, noiselessness, and silence,

01:34:21.474 --> 01:34:25.916
and also the Maqamat and all other conditions

01:34:25.916 --> 01:34:31.286
and you take them to form it into effective formula

01:34:31.286 --> 01:34:33.445
in the person's actions

01:34:33.445 --> 01:34:39.858
to make him the ideal example of the legitimate self.

01:34:39.858 --> 01:34:43.391
This is why Al-Ghazali wrote the Revival of Religious Sciences.

01:34:43.391 --> 01:34:47.530
The Revival of Religious Sciences is the summary

01:34:47.530 --> 01:34:52.383
of Islamic efforts from the previous two centuries or more.

01:34:52.383 --> 01:34:56.063
Al-Ghazali died in 505 AH.

01:34:56.063 --> 01:34:58.633
1111 AD.

01:34:58.633 --> 01:35:04.033
Sufism began in Baghdad, mainly.

01:35:04.033 --> 01:35:07.123
It had spread to other places

01:35:07.123 --> 01:35:10.515
since the beginning of the third century AH.

01:35:10.515 --> 01:35:15.244
At the end of the third century AH, its features were almost clear.

01:35:15.244 --> 01:35:19.374
In the fourth century, it evolved.

01:35:19.374 --> 01:35:24.475
At the time of al-Ghazali in the fifth century, it had a full shape

01:35:24.475 --> 01:35:28.471
and was very effective, but not as much later on.

01:35:28.471 --> 01:35:31.966
There were many great Sufis during this period.

01:35:31.966 --> 01:35:39.087
Abu Nasr as-Sarraj and many others had voices that were loud and recognized.

01:35:39.087 --> 01:35:43.874
Revival of Religious Sciences of al-Ghazali

01:35:43.874 --> 01:35:49.934
combined one leg of Sufism and one of Shari‘a in one mold.

01:35:49.934 --> 01:35:57.471
Islam stands on the legs of Sufism and Shari‘a more than any other.

01:35:57.471 --> 01:36:02.045
I call them the central domains.

01:36:02.045 --> 01:36:08.662
Shari‘a and Sufism are two central domains in Islam.

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:12.860
Let's talk about mathematics.

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:16.440
It's a secondary domain

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:21.442
because it supports the central domain and serves its objectives.

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:30.607
In today's world, art is a secondary domain that serves capitalism.

01:36:30.607 --> 01:36:37.534
Of course, it has a lot of artistic things, artistic taste, and beauty.

01:36:37.534 --> 01:36:39.326
Aesthetics, as they say

01:36:39.326 --> 01:36:46.859
Of course, when I painted these paintings, it wasn't for capitalistic reasons; I didn't want to sell them.

01:36:46.859 --> 01:36:49.887
They are mine; I made them to hang around my house.

01:36:49.887 --> 01:36:52.740
A lot of artists are like that.

01:36:52.740 --> 01:37:01.217
In the end, the power of the central domain flips the priorities of the secondary domain.

01:37:01.217 --> 01:37:05.348
If I died for example,

01:37:05.348 --> 01:37:12.907
and my daughter knows how to market them

01:37:12.907 --> 01:37:18.535
and people find these paintings beautiful.

01:37:18.535 --> 01:37:22.207
Then they buy them and resell them.

01:37:22.207 --> 01:37:26.780
Today, Picasso or other great ones,

01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:28.912
Where can you find their paintings?

01:37:28.912 --> 01:37:37.442
They are present on a yacht that a Russian billionaire bought for his girlfriend.

01:37:37.442 --> 01:37:40.612
He bought her one of Picasso's

01:37:40.612 --> 01:37:45.762
Imagine how Picasso painted his paintings

01:37:45.762 --> 01:37:49.253
And in Madrid or mainly in Paris,

01:37:49.253 --> 01:37:52.021
between 1905 until he died.

01:37:52.021 --> 01:37:55.010
Imagine what he was thinking about while painting

01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:57.549
and how his art became part of Capitalism.

01:37:57.549 --> 01:38:04.540
Insurance companies buy them and put them in the halls of huge buildings in Tokyo.

01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:09.778
What is the difference if the art didn't serve Capitalism

01:38:09.778 --> 01:38:13.880
and served a central domain like Islam?

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.099
What is going to be different about it?

01:38:16.099 --> 01:38:19.425
If the central domain was a moral domain,

01:38:19.425 --> 01:38:23.270
and that is a new topic in this discussion

01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:26.036
we could go on for hours discussing it.

01:38:26.036 --> 01:38:29.914
So, if the central domain is a moral domain,

01:38:29.914 --> 01:38:37.675
it doesn't matter how the secondary domains transform.

01:38:37.675 --> 01:38:41.040
In the end, it will serve the moral domain.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.839
And the moral domain is always a humane domain.

01:38:45.839 --> 01:38:51.121
It's humane because it cares about what's inside a human.

01:38:51.121 --> 01:38:54.471
It cares about his soul first, then his body.

01:38:54.471 --> 01:38:57.147
To his soul, his nafs (self), and his body.

01:38:57.147 --> 01:38:59.532
Shari‘a and Sufism

01:38:59.532 --> 01:39:04.594
are fundamentally central domains.

01:39:04.594 --> 01:39:10.755
By the way, Shari‘a is not essentially a legal apparatus.

01:39:10.755 --> 01:39:16.361
When I say 'legal apparatus', I use modern terminology.

01:39:16.361 --> 01:39:21.030
Does this mean that the words legal or law (qanoon) do not exist in Islamic heritage?

01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:23.791
No, it was the Turkish Qanoon that emerged

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:26.546
as a weak link or thread

01:39:26.546 --> 01:39:31.377
to increase the punishments, for example, for adultery and prostitution.

01:39:31.377 --> 01:39:37.355
However, it came to prove the basic principles of Sharia

01:39:37.355 --> 01:39:40.424
They called it law, but it's not like the law of today.

01:39:40.424 --> 01:39:49.796
Today, The Law is the legal rulings issued by the states.

01:39:49.796 --> 01:39:55.259
They are purely political and statutory issues.

01:39:55.259 --> 01:39:59.512
Ok, based on your book about the state

01:39:59.512 --> 01:40:02.218
you mentioned in your book 'Sharī'a'

01:40:02.218 --> 01:40:05.334
that the Ottoman state is the first state

01:40:05.334 --> 01:40:08.126
to choose a madhhab for itself.

01:40:08.126 --> 01:40:10.278
The Hanafi Madhhab

01:40:10.278 --> 01:40:14.236
What is the effect of choosing one madhhab on the state?

01:40:14.236 --> 01:40:15.769
And on legislation?

01:40:15.769 --> 01:40:21.317
Why did the Ottomans do it while others before them didn't?

01:40:21.317 --> 01:40:23.468
(True. Why didn't it happen before?)

01:40:23.468 --> 01:40:26.424
Before them, the Mamluks were in Egypt and Syria.

01:40:26.424 --> 01:40:29.726
They had four of them, not just one or two.

01:40:29.726 --> 01:40:33.534
They thought that all four madhhabs should have a presence.

01:40:33.534 --> 01:40:36.315
They have a chief justice for each one.

01:40:36.315 --> 01:40:41.915
The Ottomans refused and picked the Hanafi Madhhab only.

01:40:41.915 --> 01:40:44.726
But you have to look

01:40:44.726 --> 01:40:47.215
at what domain

01:40:47.215 --> 01:40:49.878
the Ottoman state was established in

01:40:49.878 --> 01:40:52.091
The Ottomans

01:40:52.091 --> 01:40:55.877
with the Safavid state

01:40:55.877 --> 01:40:58.393
and the Mughal state

01:40:58.393 --> 01:41:01.546
they were three Islamic empires

01:41:01.546 --> 01:41:05.861
that were some of the most powerful empires of that time.

01:41:05.861 --> 01:41:10.075
They were called the Gunpowder Empires.

01:41:10.075 --> 01:41:12.691
The Gunpowder Empires

01:41:12.691 --> 01:41:21.571
They were the first to import and use gunpowder and old handguns.

01:41:21.571 --> 01:41:28.146
But this name is not a matter of describing the use of weapons only.

01:41:28.146 --> 01:41:33.641
Rather, it is a description of new Islamic and non-Muslim empires

01:41:33.641 --> 01:41:38.642
that started to work differently in their political rule.

01:41:38.642 --> 01:41:40.619
There was a difference.

01:41:40.619 --> 01:41:43.979
From the the beginning of Islam to the Mamluks

01:41:43.979 --> 01:41:46.909
there was some kind of continuity.

01:41:46.909 --> 01:41:50.316
There was somewhat of a jump.

01:41:50.316 --> 01:41:53.895
It was small compared to the one in the 19th century.

01:41:53.895 --> 01:42:01.064
It was a small jump before the Ottomans rose.

01:42:01.064 --> 01:42:03.991
And the Safavids and others.

01:42:03.991 --> 01:42:07.073
But why?

01:42:07.073 --> 01:42:11.071
All of these developments

01:42:11.071 --> 01:42:13.328
happened in what is called

01:42:13.328 --> 01:42:17.715
World history.

01:42:17.715 --> 01:42:21.930
World history is a field of study.

01:42:21.930 --> 01:42:24.605
It means the whole history of the world

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:26.852
If a historian studies history

01:42:26.852 --> 01:42:31.060
of Aleppo in Syria or a village near it.

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:34.149
This is a short history.

01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:37.212
But he could study Islam

01:42:37.212 --> 01:42:42.234
or the Islam of Mamluks or Umayyads.

01:42:42.234 --> 01:42:44.432
World history

01:42:44.432 --> 01:42:49.458
covers the colloquial map

01:42:49.458 --> 01:42:53.042
to study the actions of the states and how they affect each other

01:42:53.042 --> 01:42:56.536
and their dealings with each other, and who affected who.

01:42:56.536 --> 01:43:01.385
When you only study a specific village

01:43:01.385 --> 01:43:06.438
such as the marriage practices in a village in northern China,

01:43:06.438 --> 01:43:09.304
that's fine and good for you,

01:43:09.304 --> 01:43:11.440
but you don't know much.

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.158
Because you are confined to it.

01:43:13.158 --> 01:43:15.646
Unless you start comparing and seeing

01:43:15.646 --> 01:43:19.883
It is always necessary to compare with others.

01:43:19.883 --> 01:43:24.788
Comparative studies are a new science in the human mind.

01:43:24.788 --> 01:43:27.960
If I stay without it, my mind will be different.

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:31.023
And when I import it into my mind and start comparing

01:43:31.023 --> 01:43:35.198
my mind will evolve immensely.

01:43:35.198 --> 01:43:37.621
The comparison is very important.

01:43:37.621 --> 01:43:41.286
My whole scientific project, from beginning to end,

01:43:41.286 --> 01:43:44.239
whenever I cover an area

01:43:44.239 --> 01:43:48.274
I go to another area similar to it, parallel to it, in another civilization

01:43:48.274 --> 01:43:50.098
and I see how it's doing.

01:43:50.098 --> 01:43:56.417
This is to understand the relativism of the first field that I studied

01:43:56.417 --> 01:43:58.698
which is Shari‘a for me.

01:43:58.698 --> 01:44:02.650
Comparisons are very important.

01:44:02.650 --> 01:44:06.846
What was the question again, please?

01:44:06.846 --> 01:44:09.956
(I got distracted there for a second.)

01:44:09.956 --> 01:44:15.329
It was about the Ottomans choosing the Hanafi Madhhab.

01:44:15.329 --> 01:44:21.673
We lost track while discussing a methodological topic.

01:44:21.673 --> 01:44:25.497
The Ottomans came as a reaction,

01:44:25.497 --> 01:44:27.659
part of it was a reaction,

01:44:27.659 --> 01:44:30.364
for the first European expansions.

01:44:30.364 --> 01:44:36.146
When the Ottomans rose, the Renaissance in Europe was happening.

01:44:36.146 --> 01:44:39.760
What was happening in Italy at that time,

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:43.691
and they were very close to them,

01:44:43.691 --> 01:44:49.117
What was happening in Italy and Spain at that time was very important.

01:44:49.117 --> 01:44:54.050
Part of the Ottomans in Europe and the other in Asia.

01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:56.442
This is before their occupation of Arab states

01:44:56.442 --> 01:44:58.971
like Egypt, Palestine, and Syria.

01:44:58.971 --> 01:45:02.410
When they started to develop,

01:45:02.410 --> 01:45:05.801
and when you look at who those Ottoman Sultans were,

01:45:05.801 --> 01:45:11.802
The vast majority of the Ottoman sultans' mothers

01:45:11.802 --> 01:45:17.179
who strongly ruled with their children and husbands

01:45:17.179 --> 01:45:20.933
The women of the Royal Palace in Islam

01:45:20.933 --> 01:45:24.841
had great importance and influence in governance.

01:45:24.841 --> 01:45:27.105
For example, Suleiman the Magnificent

01:45:27.105 --> 01:45:28.607
Who was his wife?

01:45:28.607 --> 01:45:30.724
She was a Christian Ukrainian.

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:34.771
He married her, and she converted to Islam and had children.

01:45:34.771 --> 01:45:36.961
She became his ruling partner..

01:45:36.961 --> 01:45:39.312
He is Suleiman the Lawgiver or Suleiman the Magnificent

01:45:39.312 --> 01:45:42.185
When you go to visit Sulaymaniyah in Istanbul,

01:45:42.185 --> 01:45:45.935
You'd say he was one of the greatest men, and he really was,

01:45:45.935 --> 01:45:48.717
but his wife was very important too.

01:45:48.717 --> 01:45:51.222
And his children as well.

01:45:51.222 --> 01:45:54.640
Who was their mother? It's Roxelana.

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.056
The Ottomans sent spies to Europe

01:45:59.056 --> 01:46:04.295
to see the latest European cannon design and build one like it in Istanbul.

01:46:04.295 --> 01:46:09.907
If you study Ottoman military history

01:46:09.907 --> 01:46:14.617
you'll find that it was filled with stories like it.

01:46:14.617 --> 01:46:16.496
Not only that,

01:46:16.496 --> 01:46:21.157
they hired Austrian and Swedish engineers

01:46:21.157 --> 01:46:26.827
they paid them a lot more than they make in Europe to get them to Istanbul

01:46:26.827 --> 01:46:30.528
to help them build this new kind of cannon.

01:46:30.528 --> 01:46:34.832
They knew a great deal about what Europeans were doing.

01:46:34.832 --> 01:46:36.727
So, what did they do about it?

01:46:36.727 --> 01:46:42.176
There is a main reason Europe became modern.

01:46:42.176 --> 01:46:44.682
The modernity we know about

01:46:44.682 --> 01:46:47.239
It's Political Centralization.

01:46:47.239 --> 01:46:51.586
Everything became concentrated in one place.

01:46:51.586 --> 01:46:54.237
They call it Centralization in English.

01:46:54.237 --> 01:46:56.552
Everything is built in one place.

01:46:56.552 --> 01:47:00.495
Because European history originated with a king.

01:47:00.495 --> 01:47:03.940
They used to call him the absolute ruler.

01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:06.338
He was the legislator.

01:47:06.338 --> 01:47:11.672
In Monarchy, the king says: I speak on behalf of God.

01:47:11.672 --> 01:47:16.217
It was the absolute ruler in Europe, or absolutism.

01:47:16.217 --> 01:47:21.810
The king thinks he is God's representative on earth.

01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:24.711
He is the law.

01:47:24.711 --> 01:47:28.587
As Louis XIV said.

01:47:28.587 --> 01:47:34.278
And he represents God on Earth and speaks for him.

01:47:34.278 --> 01:47:39.784
The Ottomans couldn't do something like that.

01:47:39.784 --> 01:47:43.977
Because of Islam and the Islamic society.

01:47:43.977 --> 01:47:48.983
If they said something like that, all the Ottoman family would be exiled.

01:47:48.983 --> 01:47:52.041
And all the Islamic peoples will rise to stop it.

01:47:52.041 --> 01:47:54.788
But this is what they did instead.

01:47:54.788 --> 01:47:59.632
They thought that having four Madhhabs was complicated and too much trouble.

01:47:59.632 --> 01:48:01.607
And there were some troubles.

01:48:01.607 --> 01:48:04.164
When you have a plurality of sects

01:48:04.164 --> 01:48:06.433
and this much freedom of law

01:48:06.433 --> 01:48:08.343
you'll have to pay its price.

01:48:08.343 --> 01:48:09.623
What was the price?

01:48:09.623 --> 01:48:12.648
We'll talk about it in a little while.

01:48:12.648 --> 01:48:20.006
They wanted to take three of the madhhabs to a lower position.

01:48:20.006 --> 01:48:21.623
Not in a negative way.

01:48:21.623 --> 01:48:27.515
And they will be managed and ruled by the Hanafi madhhab

01:48:27.515 --> 01:48:33.054
The chief Justice will be appointed in Istanbul.

01:48:33.054 --> 01:48:34.902
Let's say the Chief Justice of Egypt.

01:48:34.902 --> 01:48:37.770
So he goes from Istanbul to Cairo.

01:48:37.770 --> 01:48:43.012
While in Cairo, Alexandrea or any other

01:48:43.012 --> 01:48:48.536
He appoints judges according to who lives in this country.

01:48:48.536 --> 01:48:55.121
If there were too many Hanbalis, he would give them more than one Hanbali judge.

01:48:55.121 --> 01:48:58.822
The same is true for Shafii and the rest.

01:48:58.822 --> 01:49:01.845
It's not that they disappeared,

01:49:01.845 --> 01:49:06.011
but the Ottoman Shari‘a Administration

01:49:06.011 --> 01:49:09.171
was centralized in Istanbul.

01:49:09.171 --> 01:49:12.634
And Istanbul produced the Hanafi madhab only.

01:49:12.634 --> 01:49:17.664
The chief justice is Hanafi.

01:49:17.664 --> 01:49:21.683
The chief justice is the beholder.

01:49:21.683 --> 01:49:26.075
The beholder is the one who examines things.

01:49:26.075 --> 01:49:32.133
How have this idea and this change affected the Muslim world?

01:49:32.133 --> 01:49:39.866
It wasn't a qualitative change.

01:49:39.866 --> 01:49:42.641
It is a quantitative change.

01:49:42.641 --> 01:49:47.958
And of course, if the quantity gets too much, it becomes a quality.

01:49:47.958 --> 01:49:54.020
Quality and quantity are not two different things.

01:49:54.020 --> 01:50:00.191
If you had a white paint bowl

01:50:00.191 --> 01:50:03.186
and you put one red dot in it

01:50:03.186 --> 01:50:05.173
and you mix it, it will still be white.

01:50:05.173 --> 01:50:06.714
With a second drop it will still be white.

01:50:06.714 --> 01:50:09.607
With 100 drops, it will be mostly white.

01:50:09.607 --> 01:50:12.150
If you add a cup, it will turn pink.

01:50:12.150 --> 01:50:17.103
But if you add 10 times the amount of red paint, it will be completely red.

01:50:17.103 --> 01:50:20.503
Quality and quantity are connected.

01:50:20.503 --> 01:50:29.875
The Ottoman Empire had a kind of quantity that didn't become quality.

01:50:29.875 --> 01:50:35.639
However, this quantity,

01:50:35.639 --> 01:50:43.588
later in the nineteenth century, after the year 1826, it became important.

01:50:43.588 --> 01:50:50.207
These changes, for example, centralize the Shari‘a administratively in the Hanafi madhab.

01:50:50.207 --> 01:50:56.635
And dividing the Sanjaks and the empire in a certain way

01:50:56.635 --> 01:50:59.437
and collect taxes in a certain way.

01:50:59.437 --> 01:51:04.978
They were trying to do them all in a successful way, but for what?

01:51:04.978 --> 01:51:07.213
They were learning from Europe.

01:51:07.213 --> 01:51:10.478
It's not that they were scared; Europe was actually very weak.

01:51:10.478 --> 01:51:15.216
But when you see that your neighbor invented a new weapon,

01:51:15.216 --> 01:51:17.797
and even if you are 100 times stronger than him,

01:51:17.797 --> 01:51:20.267
you would want to know what he is doing.

01:51:20.267 --> 01:51:22.060
From a position of power.

01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:25.184
So they used to take things from Europe.

01:51:25.184 --> 01:51:30.796
One of them was facilitating the administration of the empire by this method.

01:51:30.796 --> 01:51:33.431
In 1826

01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:35.523
for the first time

01:51:35.523 --> 01:51:40.377
the Ottoman empire found itself

01:51:40.377 --> 01:51:43.015
in a very severe predicament.

01:51:43.015 --> 01:51:49.005
Since the 1777-80

01:51:49.005 --> 01:51:51.589
until a little more over 1800

01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:53.904
and a lot more later on

01:51:53.904 --> 01:51:56.574
but I am focusing on the era before 1826

01:51:56.574 --> 01:52:00.840
The Russian Tsarist

01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:06.200
was handing them crushing defeat after crushing defeat.

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:10.351
In almost every war, the Russians win.

01:52:10.351 --> 01:52:13.947
At first, the Ottomans were winning,

01:52:13.947 --> 01:52:17.782
and they took the now-disputed areas between Ukraine and Russia.

01:52:17.782 --> 01:52:22.087
like Crimea

01:52:22.087 --> 01:52:26.086
What happened in this period

01:52:26.086 --> 01:52:30.513
is that Ottomans lost war after war

01:52:30.513 --> 01:52:33.396
So much so that it ruined it economically.

01:52:33.396 --> 01:52:37.052
It began internal reforms, and they reformed armies.

01:52:37.052 --> 01:52:39.758
All of their military apparatus

01:52:39.758 --> 01:52:41.518
it happened before 1826

01:52:41.518 --> 01:52:45.818
but in 1826, the first phase of army reform had ended.

01:52:45.818 --> 01:52:47.900
This is very important.

01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:52.478
But there was a radical change

01:52:52.478 --> 01:52:56.222
it added to the quality, not just the quantity.

01:52:56.222 --> 01:53:01.841
For the first time in Islamic history,

01:53:01.841 --> 01:53:07.976
the state says that large and important Islamic Awqaf (Endowments)

01:53:07.976 --> 01:53:11.740
belongs to the capital of Istanbul.

01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:15.155
In Islamic history, Awqaf have always been independent

01:53:15.155 --> 01:53:19.883
It has its budgets, its economy,

01:53:19.883 --> 01:53:22.577
and its management, they were supervised by a judge.

01:53:22.577 --> 01:53:27.277
Every year, he checks the books, accounts, and the rest.

01:53:27.277 --> 01:53:31.547
He leaves what's theirs to them.

01:53:31.547 --> 01:53:35.904
But in 1826,

01:53:35.904 --> 01:53:39.494
All the Awqaf send their income to the capital

01:53:39.494 --> 01:53:42.692
and the capital decides how much goes back to the Awqaf.

01:53:42.692 --> 01:53:46.513
Not every Awqaf has its own budget any more.

01:53:46.513 --> 01:53:49.752
Its budget became subject to state intervention.

01:53:49.752 --> 01:53:54.385
And things started to get worse and worse for Shari‘a from that day on.

01:53:54.385 --> 01:53:59.158
If you took the Awqaf from the hands of Shari‘a, you killed Shari‘a.

01:53:59.158 --> 01:54:01.736
This is how it worked at that time.

01:54:01.736 --> 01:54:04.658
At the beginning, Shari‘a didn't need the Awqaf.

01:54:04.658 --> 01:54:06.256
But later on,

01:54:06.256 --> 01:54:09.215
at the start of the fifth century,

01:54:09.215 --> 01:54:12.657
there were Nizamiyyas in Baghdad

01:54:12.657 --> 01:54:14.900
established by Nizam al-Mulk

01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:17.227
The famous Vizier of Seljuk Empire

01:54:17.227 --> 01:54:20.213
after that, it was like a flood

01:54:20.213 --> 01:54:23.193
of Awqaf were built in Islamic history.

01:54:23.193 --> 01:54:25.501
It was everywhere you look.

01:54:25.501 --> 01:54:30.026
By the way, when the crusaders entered

01:54:30.026 --> 01:54:36.072
they learned to create their colleges

01:54:36.072 --> 01:54:38.814
in Bologna, Paris, and London

01:54:38.814 --> 01:54:41.947
From the Muslims.

01:54:41.947 --> 01:54:46.992
Columbia University is an updated version,

01:54:46.992 --> 01:54:54.167
or a modern version of the Nizamiyyas Madrasa system in Baghdad.

01:54:54.167 --> 01:55:00.754
Ok, this was the first intervention

01:55:00.754 --> 01:55:04.451
The Ottomans took Awqaf to themselves

01:55:04.451 --> 01:55:06.681
They controlled Awqaf.

01:55:06.681 --> 01:55:11.873
After about 20 years,

01:55:11.873 --> 01:55:14.634
it entered the stage of the so-called Tanzimat.

01:55:14.634 --> 01:55:19.805
In my personal opinion, the Tanzimat came in 1826, not 1856.

01:55:19.805 --> 01:55:21.355
What are these Tanzimat?

01:55:21.355 --> 01:55:25.352
The Tanzimat was the beginning

01:55:25.352 --> 01:55:29.402
of Westernization of infrastructure

01:55:29.402 --> 01:55:31.707
for the Ottoman Empire

01:55:31.707 --> 01:55:35.400
Westernization in the sense that it becomes like the West.

01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:41.391
Islamic laws have started to be left on the sidelines.

01:55:41.391 --> 01:55:48.077
They imported crime and penal codes from Germany

01:55:48.077 --> 01:55:53.105
and other laws from France and Italy.

01:55:53.105 --> 01:55:58.576
They used them instead of the Islamic laws.

01:55:58.576 --> 01:56:03.983
The first step was taken in 1852.

01:56:03.983 --> 01:56:07.599
But the Awqaf and their confiscations,

01:56:07.599 --> 01:56:10.633
in the meaning I described

01:56:10.633 --> 01:56:13.958
and not the traditional way

01:56:13.958 --> 01:56:17.115
This was in 1826

01:56:17.115 --> 01:56:22.213
In 1826, it was the first step that cleared the way

01:56:22.213 --> 01:56:25.466
to blow up

01:56:25.466 --> 01:56:29.320
a section of Islamic Shari‘a and Islamic laws

01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:31.857
in the fifties of the nineteenth century.

01:56:31.857 --> 01:56:36.843
They then started establishing European-style law schools.

01:56:36.843 --> 01:56:39.930
They created a new generation

01:56:39.930 --> 01:56:45.720
that is related to Western law and the application of Western law.

01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:47.648
Excuse me?

01:56:47.648 --> 01:56:50.228
And here is where the codification of Sharia took place?

01:56:50.228 --> 01:56:52.503
Codifying of Sharia happened later

01:56:52.503 --> 01:56:54.873
but this was the start.

01:56:54.873 --> 01:56:57.804
The 'Mecelle' is somewhat of a codification.

01:56:57.804 --> 01:57:00.741
But we'll talk about codification maybe later

01:57:00.741 --> 01:57:02.810
 because it is a little more complicated than that

01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:06.913
Let's go back to 1826 to see what happened to Awqaf.

01:57:06.913 --> 01:57:13.326
All of the Awqaf income went to Istanbul.

01:57:13.326 --> 01:57:16.373
Istanbul returns a little bit of it

01:57:16.373 --> 01:57:18.760
and they take the rest

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:21.920
to spend it on wars and other things.

01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:26.871
These new law schools

01:57:26.871 --> 01:57:31.604
train people to graduate

01:57:31.604 --> 01:57:34.461
and later hold strong positions.

01:57:34.461 --> 01:57:37.151
But at the same time,

01:57:37.151 --> 01:57:42.279
the money that went back to traditional scholars who studied Shari‘a,

01:57:42.279 --> 01:57:49.649
it was reduced to 20%–15% of what they used to get.

01:57:49.649 --> 01:57:52.392
I'll give you a small example:

01:57:52.392 --> 01:57:56.163
Imagine that China occupied America

01:57:56.163 --> 01:58:02.061
whether it was a direct occupation or the kind that forced their will

01:58:02.061 --> 01:58:05.256
because colonization has many methods

01:58:05.256 --> 01:58:10.421
and you look for the one who makes or produces

01:58:10.421 --> 01:58:19.910
the fertile grounds and the froth of the law in America

01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:23.055
They are the main educators

01:58:23.055 --> 01:58:25.824
in the well-known law schools

01:58:25.824 --> 01:58:30.001
which are Harvard, Yale, Columbia

01:58:30.001 --> 01:58:33.018
and other 4 or 5 schools.

01:58:33.018 --> 01:58:36.948
If we look at Harvard and Yale,

01:58:36.948 --> 01:58:41.401
How much do the professors make there?

01:58:41.401 --> 01:58:45.194
About $300,000 and 500,000

01:58:45.194 --> 01:58:48.090
These are their wages.

01:58:48.090 --> 01:58:52.421
This is the average.

01:58:52.421 --> 01:58:57.651
Imagine if China creates new law schools

01:58:57.651 --> 01:59:00.929
in America

01:59:00.929 --> 01:59:07.185
that decide the effective decisions

01:59:07.185 --> 01:59:10.399
in legislating the legal market

01:59:10.399 --> 01:59:12.327
in courts

01:59:12.327 --> 01:59:16.835
and we pay them between $300,000 and 500,000.

01:59:16.835 --> 01:59:23.088
while at Yale and Harvard they reduce it to $50,000.

01:59:23.088 --> 01:59:28.323
This is exactly what happened to Islam in the nineteenth century.

01:59:28.323 --> 01:59:36.202
If you look at a professor at Harvard Law School after this,

01:59:36.202 --> 01:59:42.287
who was wealthy, lived in luxury and had a high position,

01:59:42.287 --> 01:59:49.513
will he send his children to the same school?

01:59:49.513 --> 01:59:51.582
No, of course.

01:59:51.582 --> 01:59:54.118
It's fallen.

01:59:54.118 --> 01:59:56.975
They'll send their children to the new and better schools.

01:59:56.975 --> 02:00:00.137
Because they care about their children.

02:00:00.137 --> 02:00:02.342
They are the fruit of your loins.

02:00:02.342 --> 02:00:04.735
You'll send them to the best choice.

02:00:04.735 --> 02:00:08.939
Imagine with me that the schools of jurisprudence have deteriorated

02:00:08.939 --> 02:00:11.188
and it started to fade away.

02:00:11.188 --> 02:00:16.964
To the point where, in 1860 or 1870 at most,

02:00:16.964 --> 02:00:22.583
the last people who wrote in the old jurisprudential way

02:00:22.583 --> 02:00:26.240
and the old style and the old dialectical method

02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:28.820
have stopped.

02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:34.536
And a new style of writing began, which was shallow and lacked depth.

02:00:34.536 --> 02:00:38.172
And knows nothing about the past.

02:00:38.172 --> 02:00:42.879
When there were judges in Egypt in 1920,

02:00:42.879 --> 02:00:48.328
they had problems when they tried to read al-Fiqh

02:00:48.328 --> 02:00:52.124
They struggled to read and comprehend it.

02:00:52.124 --> 02:00:54.702
Here is an exaggerated example:

02:00:54.702 --> 02:01:00.909
When I was young professor,

02:01:00.909 --> 02:01:04.007
without naming any names,

02:01:04.007 --> 02:01:06.303
I met at that time

02:01:06.303 --> 02:01:12.411
the main leader in the Supreme Constitutional Court in Egypt

02:01:12.411 --> 02:01:15.458
we were talking on a street in London.

02:01:15.458 --> 02:01:19.228
He said: I get it,

02:01:19.228 --> 02:01:21.778
but why Shari‘a,

02:01:21.778 --> 02:01:25.749
the Shari‘a people write in incomprehensible codes,

02:01:25.749 --> 02:01:31.184
I can't understand their writings"

02:01:31.184 --> 02:01:35.312
He doesn't understand what al-Fiqh is or how to read it.

02:01:35.312 --> 02:01:39.535
It was so hard for him that he thinks it's written in hieroglyphs.

02:01:39.535 --> 02:01:41.894
I said, It doesn't look like that for me.

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:44.084
It doesn't look like hieroglyphs.

02:01:44.084 --> 02:01:46.468
I see brilliant logic there.

02:01:46.468 --> 02:01:51.155
This is how the construct of dialectical Islamic jurisprudence makes you feel.

02:01:51.155 --> 02:01:56.731
As we say in Palestine, "yamakhwil alʿaqla" (means eye-opening or mind-blowing)

02:01:56.731 --> 02:02:02.225
This is the effect of the Ottoman state.

02:02:02.225 --> 02:02:05.345
This is a big step of change in quality.

02:02:05.345 --> 02:02:11.087
It didn't just alter the legal and Shari‘a apparatus in the empire,

02:02:11.087 --> 02:02:17.884
but it made it a legal apparatus only and not adherent to Shari‘a.

02:02:17.884 --> 02:02:23.429
Despite all the counterfeiting and confiscations

02:02:23.429 --> 02:02:26.107
from Shari‘a in the personal status law.

02:02:26.107 --> 02:02:29.552
Which has nothing to do with Islamic jurisprudence.

02:02:29.552 --> 02:02:31.469
It was changed a lot.

02:02:31.469 --> 02:02:34.110
They had something called a device of 'talfiq'.

02:02:34.110 --> 02:02:40.087
Talfiq was one of the most important tools for modern reform.

02:02:40.087 --> 02:02:43.994
It originally started in 1917 in the Ottoman Empire.

02:02:43.994 --> 02:02:46.932
It was the Law of Family Rights of 1917

02:02:46.932 --> 02:02:52.360
They even used Shia jurisprudence.

02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.985
And they combined it with Maliki jurisprudence

02:02:54.985 --> 02:02:57.239
a few from here and there.

02:02:57.239 --> 02:03:00.000
And they say this is the new law.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.785
Who decided that? On what basis?

02:03:02.785 --> 02:03:05.557
Which jurist brought all of them together like that?

02:03:05.557 --> 02:03:09.742
That's not important. What is important is what the state decides.

02:03:09.742 --> 02:03:14.517
When you bring those together without explanation or refutation,

02:03:14.517 --> 02:03:16.665
All of al-Fiqh has been refuted.

02:03:16.665 --> 02:03:18.946
Every statement has a refutation.

02:03:18.946 --> 02:03:23.770
And the refutation alone can tell a world about the art of thinking.

02:03:23.770 --> 02:03:25.817
when you read for Al-Nawawi.

02:03:25.817 --> 02:03:28.270
And you see how he objected to al-Shafii.

02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:32.070
Even though you are al-Shafi'i,

02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:36.509
and while your result is correct, the method of refutation is wrong.

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:39.043
Or maybe it's lacking or incomplete.

02:03:39.043 --> 02:03:41.217
He writes all about it.

02:03:41.217 --> 02:03:45.662
About why did al-Shafi'i not complete this exercise in Fiqh

02:03:45.662 --> 02:03:49.831
that produced the result or statement in question?

02:03:49.831 --> 02:03:51.763
Imagine that.

02:03:51.763 --> 02:03:54.005
This is all gone now.

02:03:54.005 --> 02:03:55.957
No more refutations or anything else.

02:03:55.957 --> 02:03:59.837
That the woman is entitled to such-and-such in the contract of such-and-such.

02:03:59.837 --> 02:04:03.181
This is because we said so.

02:04:03.181 --> 02:04:05.173
OK, where is the logical structure of it?

02:04:05.173 --> 02:04:06.294
It doesn't matter.

02:04:06.294 --> 02:04:10.174
No more diligence, weighting, authentication, or anything like that.

02:04:10.174 --> 02:04:13.027
This is what the state decreed.

02:04:13.027 --> 02:04:16.533
That's why you said that the 19th century

02:04:16.533 --> 02:04:19.143
was a pivotal century in the history of Shari‘a.

02:04:19.143 --> 02:04:22.964
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,

02:04:22.964 --> 02:04:25.442
 the Ottoman Empire became a modern state.

02:04:25.442 --> 02:04:27.392
It wasn't an Islamic state.

02:04:27.392 --> 02:04:33.364
When I said it was a modern state, it wasn't meant as a complement.

02:04:33.364 --> 02:04:37.919
At the same time, I don't mean modern state as in the temporal sense.

02:04:37.919 --> 02:04:45.046
Modern means an expression of modernity, which is a special qualitative phenomenon.

02:04:45.046 --> 02:04:50.853
Therefore, there is a big difference between the so-called Islamic rule,

02:04:50.853 --> 02:04:53.537
and the so-called modern state.

02:04:53.537 --> 02:04:58.062
This is the subject of the book The Impossible State.

02:04:58.062 --> 02:05:01.794
And you see that there cannot be a modern Islamic state.

02:05:01.794 --> 02:05:06.285
If you mean by modern, the European modernist composition

02:05:06.285 --> 02:05:09.333
because the modern state is a European state.

02:05:09.333 --> 02:05:12.374
Even in China today,

02:05:12.374 --> 02:05:15.179
which is the most creative state

02:05:15.179 --> 02:05:19.340
in creating political and social fields

02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:23.557
from nothing at the beginning

02:05:23.557 --> 02:05:27.996
and later from internal data that is unique to China,

02:05:27.996 --> 02:05:32.700
will not escape the compositions of the modern state.

02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:36.183
Since we are at modernity

02:05:36.183 --> 02:05:38.612
or the modern state,

02:05:38.612 --> 02:05:40.738
I want to talk about the concept of modernity.

02:05:40.738 --> 02:05:43.221
You said: The solution to the problem of modernity

02:05:43.221 --> 02:05:47.183
is to understand how everything is related to everything else.

02:05:47.183 --> 02:05:49.753
- Because everything is interconnected.
- (Correct.)

02:05:49.753 --> 02:05:52.710
Could you elaborate?

02:05:52.710 --> 02:05:55.097
Let me ask you this question:

02:05:55.097 --> 02:06:00.543
What is one of the most important ways to rule

02:06:00.543 --> 02:06:03.518
a land that has different tribes?

02:06:03.518 --> 02:06:08.389
When the English went to America,

02:06:08.389 --> 02:06:12.479
what was their most important weapon to control the land?

02:06:12.479 --> 02:06:17.444
They allied with some tribes

02:06:17.444 --> 02:06:20.849
who they tempt with something

02:06:20.849 --> 02:06:26.683
to help them wage war against their other sister tribes.

02:06:26.683 --> 02:06:30.882
It's called the divide and conquer strategy.

02:06:30.882 --> 02:06:37.606
Dividing something is one of the most effective means of control.

02:06:37.606 --> 02:06:40.029
If you face 20 people at once,

02:06:40.029 --> 02:06:43.369
the example is very clear but this is only to show its importance,

02:06:43.369 --> 02:06:45.737
you'll lose to them.

02:06:45.737 --> 02:06:48.534
If you isolated them and took them one by one,

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:54.057
and you are strong enough, you'll finish them all.

02:06:54.057 --> 02:06:57.477
Modernity

02:06:57.477 --> 02:07:01.574
Its main goal started, continued and still continues

02:07:01.574 --> 02:07:04.195
according to the logic of control.

02:07:04.195 --> 02:07:06.241
The control of everything.

02:07:06.241 --> 02:07:09.094
And the most important thing is to control nature.

02:07:09.094 --> 02:07:12.115
However, since man is a part of nature,

02:07:12.115 --> 02:07:15.446
it becomes about man's dominance over man.

02:07:15.446 --> 02:07:22.768
As I said in 'Restating Orientalism',

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:29.666
Europe colonized itself before it colonized the world.

02:07:29.666 --> 02:07:31.457
How?

02:07:31.457 --> 02:07:35.851
It entered into a European self-transformation project.

02:07:35.851 --> 02:07:38.163
From a religious self

02:07:38.163 --> 02:07:42.275
and of course, Europe had more problems than anywhere else in the world,

02:07:42.275 --> 02:07:46.985
because Christianity in Europe was rotten.

02:07:46.985 --> 02:07:49.624
It was corrupt and cruel.

02:07:49.624 --> 02:07:52.226
It wasn't a true religion.

02:07:52.226 --> 02:07:54.953
Religion must be tolerant and compassionate

02:07:54.953 --> 02:07:58.117
Christianity in Europe was very violent.

02:07:58.117 --> 02:08:01.441
I don't blame Europeans

02:08:01.441 --> 02:08:04.492
for wanting to get out of

02:08:04.492 --> 02:08:08.688
the Christian era and the Caesarean era.

02:08:08.688 --> 02:08:13.548
The absolute Monarchy era.

02:08:13.548 --> 02:08:16.206
The absolutism

02:08:16.206 --> 02:08:18.861
Because they suffered a lot.

02:08:18.861 --> 02:08:20.678
I have no objection

02:08:20.678 --> 02:08:25.923
Because European Christianity has no legitimacy.

02:08:25.923 --> 02:08:31.449
It shouldn't have been established from the beginning.

02:08:31.449 --> 02:08:34.370
I'm not saying that about Christianity in general

02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:37.126
but only European Christianity.

02:08:37.126 --> 02:08:40.825
I know very well

02:08:40.825 --> 02:08:44.935
how Christianity is practiced in the Arab states.

02:08:44.935 --> 02:08:49.326
Christianity in Islamic states are different

02:08:49.326 --> 02:08:51.701
than Christianity in Europe.

02:08:51.701 --> 02:08:54.780
There is a completely different subjectivity.

02:08:54.780 --> 02:09:00.362
The European has brought ancient European traditions and customs

02:09:00.362 --> 02:09:03.775
to Christianity in Europe and ruined it.

02:09:03.775 --> 02:09:10.530
However, we can't say the same about the Christians in the Islamic world.

02:09:10.530 --> 02:09:15.026
Because Christians in the Islamic world absorbed Islamic values as well.

02:09:15.026 --> 02:09:17.849
So they had a different view of religion.

02:09:17.849 --> 02:09:22.570
Despite being the same religion, Christianity in the Islamic world

02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:28.064
is closer to the view of existence held by Islam than Christianity in Europe.

02:09:28.064 --> 02:09:31.093
Few people understand that.

02:09:31.093 --> 02:09:32.805
Because generalization is easy.

02:09:32.805 --> 02:09:35.647
It's easier to think that Christians everywhere are the same.

02:09:35.647 --> 02:09:37.903
But which Christians?

02:09:37.903 --> 02:09:40.725
They wanted a way out.

02:09:40.725 --> 02:09:45.705
They tried and then succeeded in getting out of it.

02:09:45.705 --> 02:09:50.691
They fell into the same troubles that they left.

02:09:50.691 --> 02:10:00.000
Catholic-Christian blackmail and atrocities in Europe have become secularized

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.342
and they entered into the state sphere

02:10:02.342 --> 02:10:06.775
and it practiced the same persecution against the citizens as Christianity did before.

02:10:06.775 --> 02:10:10.491
Carl Schmitt, the famous German philosopher,

02:10:10.491 --> 02:10:16.594
despite his Nazi affiliation, his ideas and his brain were very brilliant.

02:10:16.594 --> 02:10:22.135
He said that every important political concept in modernity today

02:10:22.135 --> 02:10:30.552
is a concept converted from Catholicism to secular language.

02:10:30.552 --> 02:10:33.541
For example,

02:10:33.541 --> 02:10:38.541
in Christianity, God was the supreme ruler.

02:10:38.541 --> 02:10:41.981
They replaced 'God' with 'State'.

02:10:41.981 --> 02:10:46.706
God was God himself, and then man became God.

02:10:46.706 --> 02:10:49.798
He ruled in the name of God in the beginning,

02:10:49.798 --> 02:10:52.492
but later he doesn't rule in the name of God;

02:10:52.492 --> 02:10:55.512
Rather, he says that he is the last reference in the judgment.

02:10:55.512 --> 02:10:57.714
Which human do you refer to here?

02:10:57.714 --> 02:11:01.791
Here we get into another issue

02:11:01.791 --> 02:11:06.096
How do people colonize themselves?

02:11:06.096 --> 02:11:08.414
For example,

02:11:08.414 --> 02:11:13.522
One of the most famous beliefs or philosophies

02:11:13.522 --> 02:11:17.799
in Marx's philosophical system,

02:11:17.799 --> 02:11:20.147
the famous philosopher

02:11:20.147 --> 02:11:23.713
regardless of how you interpret them

02:11:23.713 --> 02:11:27.498
But Marx is a respectable philosopher, like other philosophers.

02:11:27.498 --> 02:11:30.378
They have opinions that suit you and others that don't.

02:11:30.378 --> 02:11:33.091
You take what you want and leave the rest.

02:11:33.091 --> 02:11:37.013
As long as you don't fall into contradictions, this is the main condition.

02:11:37.013 --> 02:11:39.798
Marx says:

02:11:39.798 --> 02:11:44.217
In every society, there must be people

02:11:44.217 --> 02:11:47.171
who control others.

02:11:47.171 --> 02:11:50.513
He defined control through materialism.

02:11:50.513 --> 02:11:53.633
The one who is wealthy

02:11:53.633 --> 02:12:00.593
is the one who can control the social and political apparatus.

02:12:00.593 --> 02:12:03.044
And he becomes the leader.

02:12:03.044 --> 02:12:07.250
The biggest proof of it is what is happening in the United States.

02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:10.819
It is meant to represent the pinnacle of democracy worldwide.

02:12:10.819 --> 02:12:13.227
They have two parties

02:12:13.227 --> 02:12:15.752
that are mostly alike.

02:12:15.752 --> 02:12:20.989
They disagree on things that are trivial to the other world.

02:12:20.989 --> 02:12:27.661
like their disagreement on abortion, as if it's the most important thing in the world.

02:12:27.661 --> 02:12:31.061
Because their political system is unitary.

02:12:31.061 --> 02:12:34.929
- (What do you mean?)
- The two parties are alike.

02:12:34.929 --> 02:12:39.948
It's like deciding between twins.

02:12:39.948 --> 02:12:42.010
I see it as quite the opposite.

02:12:42.010 --> 02:12:43.725
What are the similarities?

02:12:43.725 --> 02:12:50.697
They disagree on things that are not considered central issues in other states.

02:12:50.697 --> 02:12:53.427
Other states have much bigger problems.

02:12:53.427 --> 02:12:58.737
But the controversy and important thing that I am trying to point to

02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:00.948
that in America,

02:13:00.948 --> 02:13:04.328
this is regarding Marx's ideas

02:13:04.328 --> 02:13:06.501
Who rules in America?

02:13:06.501 --> 02:13:10.176
One of the two parties that look alike each other a lot

02:13:10.176 --> 02:13:15.109
And who decides which party representative enters the elections?

02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:17.417
It's about who has more money.

02:13:17.417 --> 02:13:21.972
It's from AIPAC and the corporations.

02:13:21.972 --> 02:13:27.800
That's why Israel has a lot of support from the White House because it controls AIPAC

02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:36.059
All U.S. policy is based on a major and overwhelming dependency

02:13:36.059 --> 02:13:42.019
on political power and economic power

02:13:42.019 --> 02:13:45.727
The one with the money and the political weapons.

02:13:45.727 --> 02:13:48.322
How did this influence the people's decision to colonize themselves?

02:13:48.322 --> 02:13:50.955
There is a class of people,

02:13:50.955 --> 02:13:55.791
and you'll never find a regular person in America

02:13:55.791 --> 02:14:05.093
who has become the president of America

02:14:05.093 --> 02:14:08.975
against the wishes of the corporations.

02:14:08.975 --> 02:14:12.836
A person who had no help but were voted based on being

02:14:12.836 --> 02:14:20.197
accurate, correct, and faithful to the aspirations and hopes of the American people.

02:14:20.197 --> 02:14:23.463
That hasn't happened yet.

02:14:23.463 --> 02:14:30.032
The more time passes, the worse the situation becomes.

02:14:30.032 --> 02:14:33.021
This is proof of what Marx said.

02:14:33.021 --> 02:14:37.679
You have a class that uses the law to change the people

02:14:37.679 --> 02:14:44.788
that a part of them becomes the ruler later, and this circle continues to rotate.

02:14:44.788 --> 02:14:48.593
You said that from 1950 to 1970,

02:14:48.593 --> 02:14:52.316
The human was shaped as modernist subject

02:14:52.316 --> 02:14:55.368
psychologically, cognitively, mentally, and spiritually.

02:14:55.368 --> 02:14:59.340
I want to know more about the person before 1950.

02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:01.212
This depends on time

02:15:01.212 --> 02:15:04.367
but there were a lot of things in common.

02:15:04.367 --> 02:15:07.967
Even in Europe,

02:15:07.967 --> 02:15:11.953
humans before the 17th century in Europe

02:15:11.953 --> 02:15:16.798
and before the 18th and 19th centuries around the world, depending on the place.

02:15:16.798 --> 02:15:23.613
The human was related to his raising, origination, and self-formation

02:15:23.613 --> 02:15:25.514
and who he is.

02:15:25.514 --> 02:15:28.397
The question is, who are you as a human?

02:15:28.397 --> 02:15:35.551
It had to do with moral values.

02:15:35.551 --> 02:15:39.922
However, what happened in Europe after the 17th century

02:15:39.922 --> 02:15:43.215
had an effect on the whole world later on

02:15:43.215 --> 02:15:46.273
and now we are at a critical stage

02:15:46.273 --> 02:15:49.296
where even the non-European peoples

02:15:49.296 --> 02:15:54.625
the peoples in China, Japan, Africa and Asia

02:15:54.625 --> 02:15:57.309
Because of social media

02:15:57.309 --> 02:16:00.431
and Globalization

02:16:00.431 --> 02:16:08.920
There became a kind of uniformity in self-composition.

02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:15.682
If you go and visit Jakarta,

02:16:15.682 --> 02:16:19.215
and I've been visiting Jakarta for the last 30 years

02:16:19.215 --> 02:16:23.791
and have been watching it very closely to see the different changes.

02:16:23.791 --> 02:16:26.779
My first time there was in 1992

02:16:26.779 --> 02:16:28.795
and I compare it to Jakarta of today

02:16:28.795 --> 02:16:31.723
They have almost nothing to do with each other.

02:16:31.723 --> 02:16:39.165
There were only two malls in Jakarta.

02:16:39.165 --> 02:16:41.963
Mujamae tijari in Arabic

02:16:41.963 --> 02:16:45.523
There were two of them.

02:16:45.523 --> 02:16:47.682
One was smaller than the other.

02:16:47.682 --> 02:16:50.550
People buy there and leave.

02:16:50.550 --> 02:16:53.830
15 years later

02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:58.185
There are about 20 malls

02:16:58.185 --> 02:17:01.335
Each one is as big as a city.

02:17:01.335 --> 02:17:04.268
The young generation

02:17:04.268 --> 02:17:08.371
between 13 and 19, live in them.

02:17:08.371 --> 02:17:11.612
They stay from morning to night.

02:17:11.612 --> 02:17:16.085
Then came social media.

02:17:16.085 --> 02:17:19.070
All that matters to people today

02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:22.354
is not the development of the Self from the inside

02:17:22.354 --> 02:17:24.679
but only from the outside

02:17:24.679 --> 02:17:26.921
There's no care about the inside.

02:17:26.921 --> 02:17:29.385
There are no techniques

02:17:29.385 --> 02:17:34.526
the techniques that a person applies to himself

02:17:34.526 --> 02:17:40.834
to form a morally subjective personality.

02:17:40.834 --> 02:17:47.252
This shows the importance of Sufism to Shari‘a.

02:17:47.252 --> 02:17:51.414
It cared a lot more about the interior than Shari‘a.

02:17:51.414 --> 02:17:53.135
The Shari‘a did care about it

02:17:53.135 --> 02:17:54.638
but it wasn't enough

02:17:54.638 --> 02:17:56.089
So Sufism got in

02:17:56.089 --> 02:18:02.807
Today, Who is the perfect young man?

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:06.672
He is the one who exercises his muscles

02:18:06.672 --> 02:18:10.300
with the latest hair style

02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:16.122
and he wears his tight fit

02:18:16.122 --> 02:18:17.832
or slim fit

02:18:17.832 --> 02:18:22.849
There is no interest in the interior at all.

02:18:22.849 --> 02:18:24.478
Never.

02:18:24.478 --> 02:18:30.426
He lives between the restaurant and the parties

02:18:30.426 --> 02:18:34.842
and most likely drinks alcohol

02:18:34.842 --> 02:18:37.832
and visits to the beaches, etc.

02:18:37.832 --> 02:18:41.767
I have no objections to any of this at all.

02:18:41.767 --> 02:18:44.957
You go to the beach and wear what you want, as much as you want.

02:18:44.957 --> 02:18:47.415
Nothing is wrong with that.

02:18:47.415 --> 02:18:51.194
But this should be part of a substantial balance

02:18:51.194 --> 02:18:54.140
that start by taking care of the interior.

02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:57.895
This is why Foucault, famous French philosopher.

02:18:57.895 --> 02:19:01.413
people misunderstood him

02:19:01.413 --> 02:19:06.939
he spent his life in studying

02:19:06.939 --> 02:19:13.367
What factors and conditions produce different subjectives?

02:19:13.367 --> 02:19:16.059
He studied the modern prison

02:19:16.059 --> 02:19:19.188
and how it produces a certain subjective.

02:19:19.188 --> 02:19:23.861
He spent most of his life studying

02:19:23.861 --> 02:19:30.837
the Greek and Roman histories

02:19:30.837 --> 02:19:36.469
in how the Roman emperors 

02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:41.729
cared about the development of humans from the inside.

02:19:41.729 --> 02:19:46.752
He called it Technologies of the Self.

02:19:46.752 --> 02:19:51.453
The Technologies of the Self are not about what is enforced on you from outside.

02:19:51.453 --> 02:19:53.779
It's your choice.

02:19:53.779 --> 02:19:58.568
You yourself choose to do prayer, fast, etc,

02:19:58.568 --> 02:20:01.136
to remain quiet and not philosophize a lot

02:20:01.136 --> 02:20:04.520
and talk like I'm the only person in the room.

02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:10.635
These are the values that make the Self.

02:20:10.635 --> 02:20:12.975
Technologies of the Self

02:20:12.975 --> 02:20:15.291
His question was

02:20:15.291 --> 02:20:18.978
This has stopped in the 18th century,

02:20:18.978 --> 02:20:19.945
completely,

02:20:19.945 --> 02:20:21.761
'It had eroded', to quote him

02:20:21.761 --> 02:20:23.914
I'm translating it from French.

02:20:23.914 --> 02:20:26.083
It faded away.

02:20:26.083 --> 02:20:28.469
Now we don't know it.

02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:30.946
With passing of time

02:20:30.946 --> 02:20:34.860
It's fading more and more, to the point that it looks like a mysterious story.

02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:37.305
However, with Technologies of the Self

02:20:37.305 --> 02:20:39.347
that the Muslims have practiced

02:20:39.347 --> 02:20:42.765
and others like the Greeks, Indians and Chinese,

02:20:42.765 --> 02:20:48.666
we have to go back now to the first minutes of this interview

02:20:48.666 --> 02:20:50.810
There is a type of freedom

02:20:50.810 --> 02:20:55.342
which we do not know today and have completely forgotten it.

02:20:55.342 --> 02:20:57.738
Did it affect humans today?

02:20:57.738 --> 02:20:59.186
Of course.

02:20:59.186 --> 02:21:03.112
Because it created a human being who knows no meaning of freedom

02:21:03.112 --> 02:21:05.200
except economic freedom

02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:07.264
and political freedom.

02:21:07.264 --> 02:21:11.407
Political freedom here is in brackets because it is not complete freedom.

02:21:11.407 --> 02:21:14.310
To go voting

02:21:14.310 --> 02:21:16.548
is not the whole story

02:21:16.548 --> 02:21:18.812
who are you voting for, Donald Trump?

02:21:18.812 --> 02:21:23.457
He is the result of American economic violence and fraud 

02:21:23.457 --> 02:21:25.608
etc

02:21:25.608 --> 02:21:27.398
then he becomes President of America

02:21:27.398 --> 02:21:30.606
I exercised my right to vote

02:21:30.606 --> 02:21:34.172
But to what end?

02:21:34.172 --> 02:21:38.210
Despite that, and I think you are aware of it,

02:21:38.210 --> 02:21:44.799
but we can see the emergence of the idea of meditation

02:21:44.799 --> 02:21:46.679
The Buddhism

02:21:46.679 --> 02:21:49.718
Inside America and not just the world

02:21:49.718 --> 02:21:51.059
(and Sufism)

02:21:51.059 --> 02:21:56.782
In New York, we have a center of Sufism.

02:21:56.782 --> 02:21:58.609
It has nothing to do with Islam, hasn't it?

02:21:58.609 --> 02:22:00.245
Completely.

02:22:00.245 --> 02:22:03.315
The spiritual presence

02:22:03.315 --> 02:22:06.497
is present around the world.

02:22:06.497 --> 02:22:10.112
I'm very happy that you mentioned it.

02:22:10.112 --> 02:22:13.321
This is very problematic.

02:22:13.321 --> 02:22:16.931
As we used to say in the east.

02:22:16.931 --> 02:22:18.861
It's full of problems.

02:22:18.861 --> 02:22:21.615
Let's take Medicine.

02:22:21.615 --> 02:22:27.666
As a representative measurement

02:22:27.666 --> 02:22:31.890
You have two ways to deal with the body.

02:22:31.890 --> 02:22:33.730
The physical body only.

02:22:33.730 --> 02:22:35.947
Let's forget about the soul for a while.

02:22:35.947 --> 02:22:38.492
There is the Western way.

02:22:38.492 --> 02:22:41.496
Which is about eating and drinking whatever you want.

02:22:41.496 --> 02:22:45.817
And all the industries that the large food corporations manufacture.

02:22:45.817 --> 02:22:47.758
They want to sell it to you.

02:22:47.758 --> 02:22:52.674
You are a mere economic tool for them.

02:22:52.674 --> 02:22:54.518
You work and pay.

02:22:54.518 --> 02:22:56.892
You keep this wheel spinning.

02:22:56.892 --> 02:23:01.576
When you get sick, you go to the hospital, and the doctor cures you.

02:23:01.576 --> 02:23:08.907
When you eat, your stomach acids increase.

02:23:08.907 --> 02:23:12.630
They will give you medicine for that.

02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:16.124
It will dampen the acids.

02:23:16.124 --> 02:23:18.897
Now you'll even eat a lot more.

02:23:18.897 --> 02:23:23.599
You've fixed the problem of increased acidity.

02:23:23.599 --> 02:23:30.025
Now there is cancer in the large intestine.

02:23:30.025 --> 02:23:31.975
You go back to the hospital.

02:23:31.975 --> 02:23:33.342
Now, what exactly happened?

02:23:33.342 --> 02:23:37.254
They sold you food, you ate it, and you paid for it.

02:23:37.254 --> 02:23:41.564
They made you sick, and you went to the hospital to pay them again for treatment.

02:23:41.564 --> 02:23:45.056
This is capitalist economic logic.

02:23:45.056 --> 02:23:47.349
This is the logic of medicine today.

02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:51.023
There is no care for

02:23:51.023 --> 02:23:55.415
the self.

02:23:55.415 --> 02:23:57.520
Take Chinese wisdom

02:23:57.520 --> 02:23:59.691
It's the opposite of that.

02:23:59.691 --> 02:24:02.781
Chinese wisdom is not about the wisdom of treatment

02:24:02.781 --> 02:24:05.073
but the wisdom of prevention

02:24:05.073 --> 02:24:09.734
The best solution to disease is to not get sick.

02:24:09.734 --> 02:24:13.056
They advise you to eat and drink a variety of things.

02:24:13.056 --> 02:24:16.938
All healthy and great for the body.

02:24:16.938 --> 02:24:20.501
They also say to exercise.

02:24:20.501 --> 02:24:22.857
And not the violent sports

02:24:22.857 --> 02:24:24.625
only simple sports

02:24:24.625 --> 02:24:26.828
Nothing dangerous about Karate

02:24:26.828 --> 02:24:30.245
You don't need to buy equipment for it.

02:24:30.245 --> 02:24:33.408
You can do wonders with your own body.

02:24:33.408 --> 02:24:37.631
Now take what you have mentioned.

02:24:37.631 --> 02:24:47.439
There is a big difference between prevention and treatment

02:24:47.439 --> 02:24:53.175
treatment is called therapy in the West.

02:24:53.175 --> 02:25:01.943
In my opinion, this book is one of the most important books in the 20th century

02:25:01.943 --> 02:25:10.606
by Philip Rieff

02:25:10.606 --> 02:25:15.611
It's called The triumph of the therapeutic.

02:25:15.611 --> 02:25:18.661
Our civilization today

02:25:18.661 --> 02:25:21.918
is about that if you got sick

02:25:21.918 --> 02:25:26.180
and you have all the reasons to get sick psychologically and physically

02:25:26.180 --> 02:25:29.816
And after you get sick, you go to see a psychiatrist.

02:25:29.816 --> 02:25:31.859
You start Yoga

02:25:31.859 --> 02:25:35.861
You become a member of the Sufi Center in New York

02:25:35.861 --> 02:25:39.149
This is after everything have deteriorated

02:25:39.149 --> 02:25:41.791
Now Sufism happens

02:25:41.791 --> 02:25:44.615
Let's stay with Sufism because it's like yoga and the others.

02:25:44.615 --> 02:25:47.531
when you go to the Sufi center here in New York

02:25:47.531 --> 02:25:50.936
you'll do there as you do with yoga.

02:25:50.936 --> 02:25:55.676
How to describe what is happening here?

02:25:55.676 --> 02:25:58.216
You are sick

02:25:58.216 --> 02:26:00.686
I hope you don't

02:26:00.686 --> 02:26:04.270
You are sick so you go there

02:26:04.270 --> 02:26:07.355
psychologically, physically, or both

02:26:07.355 --> 02:26:11.163
You want a treatment through calm and tranquility

02:26:11.163 --> 02:26:13.520
Self-reassurance 

02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:18.273
which he can get a little bit of from the Sufi center.

02:26:18.273 --> 02:26:20.295
But when leave the center

02:26:20.295 --> 02:26:26.523
and he leaves his house after he meditated

02:26:26.523 --> 02:26:30.136
a meditation for 15-20 minutes

02:26:30.136 --> 02:26:34.171
Now he'll face the outer world

02:26:34.171 --> 02:26:42.190
which causes him troubles and distress every hour

02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:46.130
and you go back home to do yoga.

02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:49.226
This isn't part of

02:26:49.226 --> 02:26:54.044
The return of these ancient religions to modernity 

02:26:54.044 --> 02:26:57.124
is a therapeutic return and not a prevention

02:26:57.124 --> 02:27:02.530
While Sufism and yoga

02:27:02.530 --> 02:27:08.481
and even the martial arts

02:27:08.481 --> 02:27:14.342
Military sports, karate, judo and taekwondo

02:27:14.342 --> 02:27:18.649
Now it's imported and used falsely

02:27:18.649 --> 02:27:20.938
and they use it as a treatment

02:27:20.938 --> 02:27:26.146
Because after working 10 hours in a bank or law firm

02:27:26.146 --> 02:27:30.400
He will be bored that he wants to go out and do something else

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:34.275
So he goes at night to a club or a center

02:27:34.275 --> 02:27:36.869
takes an hour of karate

02:27:36.869 --> 02:27:39.376
He relives himself and be a little bit more happy at home

02:27:39.376 --> 02:27:40.970
But it's not a solution

02:27:40.970 --> 02:27:44.473
As you know in Kung Fu

02:27:44.473 --> 02:27:50.017
It's part of a religious and philosophical practices are very deep until today

02:27:50.017 --> 02:27:52.255
If you went to china,

02:27:52.255 --> 02:27:54.935
to the Kung Fu centers in In the mountains

02:27:54.935 --> 02:27:58.646
they are very few because they were eliminated by the Chinese government

02:27:58.646 --> 02:28:01.345
But you can find them and see them.

02:28:01.345 --> 02:28:05.274
You can watch them on YouTube.

02:28:05.274 --> 02:28:09.509
Kung Fu is a section of religious practices.

02:28:09.509 --> 02:28:15.571
The part of taking care of the body as a religious entity.

02:28:15.571 --> 02:28:17.595
You are God's begotten.

02:28:17.595 --> 02:28:26.425
And you take care of the body because you are the guardian.

02:28:26.425 --> 02:28:29.894
And the caretaker.

02:28:29.894 --> 02:28:32.320
The body is not yours.

02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:34.545
This is a religious view.

02:28:34.545 --> 02:28:37.200
It has a very great value that we have forgotten today.

02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:39.810
The care of the inside

02:28:39.810 --> 02:28:42.074
is a kind of worship

02:28:42.074 --> 02:28:47.596
When we say that Sufism is worship

02:28:47.596 --> 02:28:49.958
People will say what are you saying?

02:28:49.958 --> 02:28:52.444
It's definitely a worship, it doesn't need an explanation.

02:28:52.444 --> 02:28:57.838
Now why Sufism is a worship but when you add yoga it stopped being a worship?

02:28:57.838 --> 02:29:00.707
It's became a healing to an illness now.

02:29:00.707 --> 02:29:12.367
The strong person who has no need and has no problem with frustration and despair

02:29:12.367 --> 02:29:16.388
He faces a lot of problems in life

02:29:16.388 --> 02:29:18.409
but he is strong

02:29:18.409 --> 02:29:19.926
He can take it

02:29:19.926 --> 02:29:22.886
He lives a life in a way and he is happy in general

02:29:22.886 --> 02:29:29.861
And knows how to isolate the bad from the good

02:29:29.861 --> 02:29:33.661
He doesn't need these things.

02:29:33.661 --> 02:29:38.342
Because he is developed in the inside an inner citadel

02:29:38.342 --> 02:29:40.950
What Pierre Hadot,

02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:43.326
who influenced Michel Foucault

02:29:43.326 --> 02:29:47.212
Pierre called it The Inner Citadel

02:29:47.212 --> 02:29:50.538
If you have an inner citadel

02:29:50.538 --> 02:29:54.956
the yoga will be just a superficial thing for you.

02:29:54.956 --> 02:29:56.627
What is this citadel?

02:29:56.627 --> 02:30:02.165
It's the technologies of the Self that is based on morals.

02:30:02.165 --> 02:30:06.818
When you are hungry and fasting, you fast as the Sufi.

02:30:06.818 --> 02:30:11.064
Imagine the magnitude of your ability to control yourself.

02:30:11.064 --> 02:30:18.822
Whoever doesn't control himself, doesn't control anything.

02:30:18.822 --> 02:30:23.186
The first thing you do if you want to rule

02:30:23.186 --> 02:30:26.875
and this is the Islamic logic for any ruler:

02:30:26.875 --> 02:30:29.984
First rule yourself before you rule others.

02:30:29.984 --> 02:30:35.629
AL-Ghazali and others when they all wrote,

02:30:35.629 --> 02:30:39.673
like Al-Mawardi and Ibn Jama'ah,

02:30:39.673 --> 02:30:43.263
the most important advice to the Sultan and the Caliph.

02:30:43.263 --> 02:30:46.948
AL-Ghazali said: Do know that, O Sultan of the world

02:30:46.948 --> 02:30:49.081
King of East and West

02:30:49.081 --> 02:30:55.263
Allah have given bounties that is apparent and many

02:30:55.263 --> 02:30:59.663
and in ten pages after that

02:30:59.663 --> 02:31:05.104
what you do to express your gratitude to Allah, the Giver

02:31:05.104 --> 02:31:07.109
This is the basis of the ruling.

02:31:07.109 --> 02:31:09.808
Fasting is among them

02:31:09.808 --> 02:31:12.921
The system of fasting

02:31:12.921 --> 02:31:16.901
we do it in Ramadan

02:31:16.901 --> 02:31:20.178
but its goal is bigger than how we understand it
 

02:31:20.178 --> 02:31:21.806
Religious values in my opinion

02:31:21.806 --> 02:31:24.733
Although practiced today, but after practicing it

02:31:24.733 --> 02:31:27.903
its philosophical concept was weakened.

02:31:27.903 --> 02:31:31.797
The old Muslim before one thousand years ago

02:31:31.797 --> 02:31:33.631
when he fasts

02:31:33.631 --> 02:31:36.008
by the same degree of education and awareness

02:31:36.008 --> 02:31:39.798
his understanding of the philosophy of fasting in Ramadan

02:31:39.798 --> 02:31:48.812
was bigger and deeper than what a Muslim have in the 21th century

02:31:48.812 --> 02:31:56.385
Because the underlying philosophy which is the basis of

02:31:56.385 --> 02:31:59.346
Technologies of the Self

02:31:59.346 --> 02:32:02.754
is a lost Sufi techniques

02:32:02.754 --> 02:32:04.611
and we don't know it today.

02:32:04.611 --> 02:32:07.640
Ok, about the human

02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:11.524
How does modernist person view the world today?

02:32:11.524 --> 02:32:20.912
He sees it as a fun play area

02:32:20.912 --> 02:32:29.170
The word used most among people is the word fun.

02:32:29.170 --> 02:32:32.201
The important thing is that the one be happy

02:32:32.201 --> 02:32:34.376
But we noticed

02:32:34.376 --> 02:32:37.258
that the more happy they are

02:32:37.258 --> 02:32:40.095
in a sense that the more money they have

02:32:40.095 --> 02:32:42.134
and more cars

02:32:42.134 --> 02:32:47.702
They make an income that no one have made like it in human history.

02:32:47.702 --> 02:32:50.424
Today, young people in their thirties

02:32:50.424 --> 02:32:55.186
in technology and computer industry

02:32:55.186 --> 02:32:58.590
they make huge money

02:32:58.590 --> 02:33:03.023
they become billionaires before they reach 35 years old

02:33:03.023 --> 02:33:04.864
They have everything.

02:33:04.864 --> 02:33:08.821
They bought houses and islands.

02:33:08.821 --> 02:33:14.661
They built luxury homes on beautiful islands

02:33:14.661 --> 02:33:18.143
They have all the possibilities

02:33:18.143 --> 02:33:21.915
But they are ridden by despair and frustration,

02:33:21.915 --> 02:33:25.669
and depression and sadness

02:33:25.669 --> 02:33:29.733
More than any people in the history of mankind

02:33:29.733 --> 02:33:32.000
The poor

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:35.392
is happier than the rich even today

02:33:35.392 --> 02:33:39.713
But the poor in old history is a million times happier than the richest today

02:33:39.713 --> 02:33:43.703
The law is the same, the more wealthy you are in modernity

02:33:43.703 --> 02:33:48.109
The more desperate and sad you are.

02:33:48.109 --> 02:33:50.429
(Wasn't it like that before modernism?)

02:33:50.429 --> 02:33:51.829
Why is it like that?

02:33:51.829 --> 02:33:53.861
-From the inside?
-(Yes)

02:33:53.861 --> 02:33:56.210
Didn't they feel like that before?

02:33:56.210 --> 02:33:59.422
They were not on the same average

02:33:59.422 --> 02:34:02.542
I use the average because you always have exceptions

02:34:02.542 --> 02:34:07.819
Maybe one in a thousand will be excluded from the rule that you are talking about

02:34:07.819 --> 02:34:11.522
But when you look at what the wealthy Muslims did

02:34:11.522 --> 02:34:15.836
The wealthy Muslims,

02:34:15.836 --> 02:34:20.989
in every customary and ordinary

02:34:20.989 --> 02:34:25.228
in the Islamic system

02:34:25.228 --> 02:34:31.154
that states that money has to go around.

02:34:31.154 --> 02:34:36.167
Who built the huge buildings in Islam

02:34:36.167 --> 02:34:41.102
all the schools and mosques

02:34:41.102 --> 02:34:45.306
the water wells for the roads and also the bridges

02:34:45.306 --> 02:34:48.124
Who built them?

02:34:48.124 --> 02:34:51.556
It's built by wealthy Muslims.

02:34:51.556 --> 02:34:55.249
Sultans, ministers and pashas.

02:34:55.249 --> 02:34:57.674
And the big merchants.

02:34:57.674 --> 02:35:02.456
Every one who do good deeds

02:35:02.456 --> 02:35:06.322
is an internal value.

02:35:06.322 --> 02:35:09.703
Their deeds weren't just for show.

02:35:09.703 --> 02:35:15.644
There were some who did it to get a higher place in society.

02:35:15.644 --> 02:35:19.058
This a human nature.

02:35:19.058 --> 02:35:22.678
Some pay it no mind.

02:35:22.678 --> 02:35:25.872
They have Inner conviction

02:35:25.872 --> 02:35:32.001
that the practices that originate from religion

02:35:32.001 --> 02:35:39.962
insist on moral acts and deeds that are part of the religion

02:35:39.962 --> 02:35:46.045
It was a way to personal salvation.

02:35:46.045 --> 02:35:49.621
Most people in the West don't believe

02:35:49.621 --> 02:35:51.757
and they don't have the motives.

02:35:51.757 --> 02:35:53.983
Even if they believed and went to the church

02:35:53.983 --> 02:35:57.505
they do very strange things honestly.

02:35:57.505 --> 02:36:00.661
A CEO of a big corporation

02:36:00.661 --> 02:36:05.126
goes to church with his family

02:36:05.126 --> 02:36:08.288
and they do all their religious duties

02:36:08.288 --> 02:36:12.717
and he might even pay a few hundreds of dollars to the poor.

02:36:12.717 --> 02:36:16.590
But the next Monday

02:36:16.590 --> 02:36:20.618
he will be sitting in his office in that big corporation

02:36:20.618 --> 02:36:24.577
that extorts and steals people's money, and does very bad things.

02:36:24.577 --> 02:36:30.437
Take Walmart as an example

02:36:30.437 --> 02:36:34.686
or how do they treat their workers in Amazon

02:36:34.686 --> 02:36:36.478
and how they make their food

02:36:36.478 --> 02:36:44.910
How many people paid exorbitant prices just for the upper class in Amazon to be this rich.

02:36:44.910 --> 02:36:50.558
This is because there is no religious motivations.

02:36:50.558 --> 02:36:53.512
There have none of the techniques of the self

02:36:53.512 --> 02:36:58.815
The inner self of the modernist human

02:36:58.815 --> 02:37:02.014
is an empty inner self

02:37:02.014 --> 02:37:14.802
When did morals got separated from man, state, and corporations?

02:37:14.802 --> 02:37:18.619
It started in the 17th century in Europe.

02:37:18.619 --> 02:37:26.644
Nothing starts at a certain point in history, and it starts from nothing.

02:37:26.644 --> 02:37:30.038
Except Allah creation

02:37:30.038 --> 02:37:32.037
"He says to it, 'Be' and it is". Yasin:82

02:37:32.037 --> 02:37:34.078
But everything else

02:37:34.078 --> 02:37:36.025
in the human phenomenon

02:37:36.025 --> 02:37:38.630
in the 17th century, 

02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:44.423
there could a few general and unclear things that happened a little before it

02:37:44.423 --> 02:37:46.400
I think that

02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:48.460
it could be in the 16th or 15th

02:37:48.460 --> 02:37:50.597
a few things that happened slowly

02:37:50.597 --> 02:37:53.577
However, in the 17th century, its basic features appeared

02:37:53.577 --> 02:37:58.053
Which are new concepts that have began in Europe.

02:37:58.053 --> 02:38:02.421
There were big movements

02:38:02.421 --> 02:38:05.762
in science and others.

02:38:05.762 --> 02:38:08.518
What is called Mechanical Movements

02:38:08.518 --> 02:38:12.228
The mechanical philosophers.

02:38:12.228 --> 02:38:16.400
There are other philosophical movements 

02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:20.511
I don't know the Arabic term because it didn't exist in Arabic

02:38:20.511 --> 02:38:22.670
It's Deism.

02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:25.920
What do these movements say?

02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:28.099
They say we're Christians

02:38:28.099 --> 02:38:31.586
and we acknowledge the existence of God.

02:38:31.586 --> 02:38:35.165
We didn't do anything wrong.

02:38:35.165 --> 02:38:37.075
God created Earth.

02:38:37.075 --> 02:38:39.780
We believe in Him.

02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:42.145
Nothing is wrong with that.

02:38:42.145 --> 02:38:43.533
However,

02:38:43.533 --> 02:38:45.047
He created Earth

02:38:45.047 --> 02:38:47.618
Made it work like a hand watch

02:38:47.618 --> 02:38:53.186
and He gave man the freedom to control this watch.

02:38:53.186 --> 02:38:57.714
And He left the scene.

02:38:57.714 --> 02:39:00.761
According to mechanical philosophers

02:39:00.761 --> 02:39:04.313
Allah created Earth and disappeared.

02:39:04.313 --> 02:39:06.628
By the way

02:39:06.628 --> 02:39:09.968
this is related to ancient Greek philosophy

02:39:09.968 --> 02:39:13.170
that was objected by al-Ghazali, Ibn Taymiyyah, and all Muslims 

02:39:13.170 --> 02:39:16.412
Does Allah knows the particulars or not?

02:39:16.412 --> 02:39:18.331
it's a problem, 

02:39:18.331 --> 02:39:23.088
and a very big issue that is philosophical, theological, and speculative 

02:39:23.088 --> 02:39:25.633
It started from the Greek era

02:39:25.633 --> 02:39:30.762
It continued and the discussion increased about it in Islam

02:39:30.762 --> 02:39:33.602
This is not only a philosophical question.

02:39:33.602 --> 02:39:37.228
It's purely a political and legal question.

02:39:37.228 --> 02:39:39.847
If Allah doesn't know the particulars 

02:39:39.847 --> 02:39:42.903
it means you can do whatever you want.

02:39:42.903 --> 02:39:46.307
But if He knows the particulars 

02:39:46.307 --> 02:39:50.974
He will know if you even had a negative thought.

02:39:50.974 --> 02:39:53.996
Before you even do the bad thing.

02:39:53.996 --> 02:39:58.382
If you lust after a woman you shouldn't lust after,

02:39:58.382 --> 02:40:01.281
it means Allah will know about it.

02:40:01.281 --> 02:40:05.373
It will be written in your book, your record .

02:40:05.373 --> 02:40:08.910
Until the Day of Judgment, when you will be held accountable for it.

02:40:08.910 --> 02:40:12.307
Unless you did more good deeds then Allah forgive you.

02:40:12.307 --> 02:40:18.081
The subject here is that God knows everything.

02:40:18.081 --> 02:40:21.786
This has political significance.

02:40:21.786 --> 02:40:28.165
Because it means that the law and Shari‘a 

02:40:28.165 --> 02:40:31.223
and every action that a human does

02:40:31.223 --> 02:40:33.926
not only does it have a punishment on Earth,

02:40:33.926 --> 02:40:36.129
it has a punishment in the Afterlife.

02:40:36.129 --> 02:40:40.491
The person who grows and raised with only one punishment in life

02:40:40.491 --> 02:40:45.817
if you escape it, there will be nothing after it

02:40:45.817 --> 02:40:52.316
But if you couldn't escape it, you will be punished here only.

02:40:52.316 --> 02:40:54.977
While in Islam

02:40:54.977 --> 02:40:58.987
Allah watches everything

02:40:58.987 --> 02:41:03.140
and He didn't lock the world door and leave

02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:07.880
The person who committed something

02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:10.003
will be punished today

02:41:10.003 --> 02:41:13.914
and a lot more later.

02:41:13.914 --> 02:41:18.779
This creates an obedient self

02:41:18.779 --> 02:41:21.211
obedient personality

02:41:21.211 --> 02:41:25.531
that may practice the moral system

02:41:25.531 --> 02:41:28.746
which is Shari‘a in this case

02:41:28.746 --> 02:41:32.768
even if no one holds you accountable for it here on earth

02:41:32.768 --> 02:41:36.345
even f there were no police in front of you

02:41:36.345 --> 02:41:39.385
whether your parents are there or not

02:41:39.385 --> 02:41:41.844
Being observed or or not

02:41:41.844 --> 02:41:44.403
It doesn't matter, there is a Higher observer

02:41:44.403 --> 02:41:45.883
You have two personalities

02:41:45.883 --> 02:41:47.728
two selves

02:41:47.728 --> 02:41:53.093
completely different from each other just because of this theological assumption

02:41:53.093 --> 02:41:57.701
Let us continue the story of Europe

02:41:57.701 --> 02:42:01.709
When this movement took place

02:42:01.709 --> 02:42:05.731
it was a transition from the Catholic church

02:42:05.731 --> 02:42:09.109
to the middle stage, which is the mechanical

02:42:09.109 --> 02:42:14.769
that recognizes God, but does not recognize His ability to manage human affairs.

02:42:14.769 --> 02:42:21.515
In Christianity in Europe, God lost the power of legislation

02:42:21.515 --> 02:42:27.433
and the power of accountability for the violations of laws and legislations.

02:42:27.433 --> 02:42:29.497
These are two stages.

02:42:29.497 --> 02:42:33.061
-This the 17th century
- The 17th and 18th century

02:42:33.061 --> 02:42:39.770
After that, new movements began to say that we are not bound by religion at all.

02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:41.849
God didn't just leave us

02:42:41.849 --> 02:42:46.333
but all religious concepts are not for us

02:42:46.333 --> 02:42:48.861
from this moment onward

02:42:48.861 --> 02:42:50.694
We have to think about

02:42:50.694 --> 02:42:53.921
that even if there was a religion

02:42:53.921 --> 02:42:58.921
this religion has nothing to do with political matters and society.

02:42:58.921 --> 02:43:02.215
This is the difference between Heresy

02:43:02.215 --> 02:43:05.004
and Secularism.

02:43:05.004 --> 02:43:08.424
Heresy is the lack of recognition in God. The disbelief.

02:43:08.424 --> 02:43:11.550
You are saying that God does not exist.

02:43:11.550 --> 02:43:14.455
While secularism

02:43:14.455 --> 02:43:18.019
acknowledges the existence of God

02:43:18.019 --> 02:43:21.067
Sunday morning you have to be at church

02:43:21.067 --> 02:43:25.495
But Monday morning, you can go and commit any crimes you want.

02:43:25.495 --> 02:43:28.618
This is the result of secularism

02:43:28.618 --> 02:43:35.224
Because now there is no relation between religion as a moral system for Sunday

02:43:35.224 --> 02:43:39.870
and the rest of the days in Christian

02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:42.791
In Islam there is no such difference.

02:43:42.791 --> 02:43:47.035
The Islamic way lasted 14 centuries

02:43:47.035 --> 02:43:53.825
But today, some Muslims are doing almost like what Christians have been doing

02:43:53.825 --> 02:43:58.551
They have some religious rituals

02:43:58.551 --> 02:44:06.231
but they don't look at the effects of their worship when Monday morning comes

02:44:06.231 --> 02:44:09.754
General responsibility towards society.

02:44:09.754 --> 02:44:12.179
This is a moral responsibility.

02:44:12.179 --> 02:44:17.621
There's no interest in anyone else,

02:44:17.621 --> 02:44:21.080
except your main family,

02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:24.655
unless it was without moral motives.

02:44:24.655 --> 02:44:28.009
The more morals decay

02:44:28.009 --> 02:44:33.212
the more you become irresponsible towards society

02:44:33.212 --> 02:44:36.398
and its problems and to others.

02:44:36.398 --> 02:44:39.401
As Taha Abdel Rahman said,

02:44:39.401 --> 02:44:43.050
There is no human being without morals.

02:44:43.050 --> 02:44:46.514
Morality is what makes a human being.

02:44:46.514 --> 02:44:53.438
Any human being without morals is a machine

02:44:53.438 --> 02:45:00.103
He is soulless and irresponsible, and he can commit any crime without knowing it.

02:45:00.103 --> 02:45:05.440
In Europe

02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:10.934
there was a separation between morals and everything else

02:45:10.934 --> 02:45:21.722
David Hume, the famous Scottish philosopher, 

02:45:21.722 --> 02:45:28.573
He said there was complete segregation

02:45:28.573 --> 02:45:32.538
between 'what is' and 'what ought to be'

02:45:32.538 --> 02:45:36.366
The things about what is, are the existing things

02:45:36.366 --> 02:45:39.854
and what ought to be are the ethics.

02:45:39.854 --> 02:45:44.341
When I say this is a mountain. It's the truth.

02:45:44.341 --> 02:45:46.038
It's in front of everybody

02:45:46.038 --> 02:45:49.034
But what is the meaning of the mountain for you and me.

02:45:49.034 --> 02:45:54.717
For you, this mountain is good that I can build houses investments on it

02:45:54.717 --> 02:46:00.131
and build swimming pools

02:46:00.131 --> 02:46:02.323
and hunting areas.

02:46:02.323 --> 02:46:08.053
The other says, SubhanAllah, such a beauty.

02:46:08.053 --> 02:46:12.049
Just looking at the mountain is a blessing for me.

02:46:12.049 --> 02:46:15.522
I like to go visit and walk on it and come back.

02:46:15.522 --> 02:46:17.940
I enjoy its fresh air.

02:46:17.940 --> 02:46:20.843
These are two completely different people.

02:46:20.843 --> 02:46:27.568
The first one is with 'what is'.

02:46:27.568 --> 02:46:30.001
But the second is a man of morals.

02:46:30.001 --> 02:46:33.533
Recognizes the beauty of the mountain, for the sake of the mountain itself

02:46:33.533 --> 02:46:35.510
For the Creator of the mountain

02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:39.669
For the relationship of the mountain to the humanity created by God.

02:46:39.669 --> 02:46:42.175
And it doesn't prevent building on it.

02:46:42.175 --> 02:46:44.631
To a certain extent.

02:46:44.631 --> 02:46:46.657
Exploitation must be limited.

02:46:46.657 --> 02:46:49.043
You can't go to every mountain and build 2000 houses

02:46:49.043 --> 02:46:52.218
This destroys the Earth. This is what is happening now.

02:46:52.218 --> 02:46:56.457
This should be well known.

02:46:56.457 --> 02:47:00.724
Any beach 

02:47:00.724 --> 02:47:03.774
that had 3 or 4 story building

02:47:03.774 --> 02:47:09.035
this changes the airway

02:47:09.035 --> 02:47:11.744
and nature in that area completely

02:47:11.744 --> 02:47:16.973
This is just because you built a tall building, without building factories or anything destructive

02:47:16.973 --> 02:47:24.752
If God wanted tall buildings on the beach He would have created them.

02:47:24.752 --> 02:47:27.716
God has no need for us to do it for Him.

02:47:27.716 --> 02:47:30.820
Everything has a reason.

02:47:30.820 --> 02:47:37.330
There are reasons for the many types of fish in the sea

02:47:37.330 --> 02:47:40.156
Allah created everything with a reason.

02:47:40.156 --> 02:47:43.061
He didn't create anything in vain.

02:47:43.061 --> 02:47:49.976
We don't know that there is a moral system that connects everything to everything.

02:47:49.976 --> 02:47:53.640
Playing with one of them, affects the rest.

02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:57.249
Ethics isn't just about behaving well

02:47:57.249 --> 02:48:00.138
and being nice to people

02:48:00.138 --> 02:48:03.840
ethics are more than that

02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:08.991
is knowing that you don't have to search too much in the secrets of the universe

02:48:08.991 --> 02:48:11.062
because you won't understand it.

02:48:11.062 --> 02:48:13.017
Science has its goals.

02:48:13.017 --> 02:48:16.795
Science today is about control, and only control.

02:48:16.795 --> 02:48:21.983
Its goals is how to live more than 200 years or even forever.

02:48:21.983 --> 02:48:27.972
How can we clone ourselves.

02:48:27.972 --> 02:48:33.166
Those who think this way

02:48:33.166 --> 02:48:35.186
are the stupidest idiots.

02:48:35.186 --> 02:48:36.794
I'll get back to that because it's important.

02:48:36.794 --> 02:48:40.258
But I have two questions about what you said.

02:48:40.258 --> 02:48:45.418
Is every human being today necessarily modern?

02:48:45.418 --> 02:48:47.809
Or just some of them?

02:48:47.809 --> 02:48:54.635
Modernity is a phenomenon that is constantly forming.

02:48:54.635 --> 02:48:59.791
In the West for example,

02:48:59.791 --> 02:49:03.193
The pinnacle of the modernist self

02:49:03.193 --> 02:49:06.292
existed in the West in 1990.

02:49:06.292 --> 02:49:11.448
The modernist self in the 1990,

02:49:11.448 --> 02:49:14.016
before social media.

02:49:14.016 --> 02:49:16.072
You connected 1990 with

02:49:16.072 --> 02:49:21.266
As a section of the modernist phenomena is social media

02:49:21.266 --> 02:49:23.352
There are many other things.

02:49:23.352 --> 02:49:27.077
Subjectivity in modernity

02:49:27.077 --> 02:49:30.157
It was on top in the West in 1990

02:49:30.157 --> 02:49:32.818
So you find that this was the highest degree of modernity

02:49:32.818 --> 02:49:36.779
Because the West are leaders in this thing, which is a problem.

02:49:36.779 --> 02:49:43.509
But 25 years later

02:49:43.509 --> 02:49:45.473
or 30 years later

02:49:45.473 --> 02:49:51.195
More than 30 years since 1990.

02:49:51.195 --> 02:49:55.204
You find that the modernist self has changed

02:49:55.204 --> 02:50:01.538
The person before the social media was one thing, and after it  became another thing

02:50:01.538 --> 02:50:06.286
Notice in behavior, in the gaze to the body and the human spirit

02:50:06.286 --> 02:50:09.498
How do people dress? How young men and women wear things today?

02:50:09.498 --> 02:50:15.903
What is the meaning of sex in all this? What is called sexual freedom

02:50:15.903 --> 02:50:17.708
all have changed a lot.

02:50:17.708 --> 02:50:20.293
Even in the last 10 years.

02:50:20.293 --> 02:50:23.484
These are not only changes

02:50:23.484 --> 02:50:32.106
I also say that these changes are at the heart of modernist self-change.

02:50:32.106 --> 02:50:36.326
The modernist person today in the West who is at the top of modernity

02:50:36.326 --> 02:50:38.202
in 2023

02:50:38.202 --> 02:50:43.269
Differs strongly

02:50:43.269 --> 02:50:50.015
From the same generation that reached this stage in 1990 only

02:50:50.015 --> 02:50:55.977
Imagine how 1950, 1930, or 1880 would be.

02:50:55.977 --> 02:50:59.472
All of modernity is evolving.

02:50:59.472 --> 02:51:06.371
For that we can't say that everyone reaches the same degree of modernity in the world at the same stage.

02:51:06.371 --> 02:51:08.968
But everyone got into the modernity 

02:51:08.968 --> 02:51:11.279
To varying degrees

02:51:11.279 --> 02:51:15.967
Social media has made this difference less in the world

02:51:15.967 --> 02:51:20.252
In the villages of China and India.

02:51:20.252 --> 02:51:23.157
maybe they have it a little less.

02:51:23.157 --> 02:51:28.559
Because they have phones and they see all that is happening in the world

02:51:28.559 --> 02:51:36.010
But they don't have the means to program themselves or to sculpt themselves

02:51:36.010 --> 02:51:38.909
to be able to form their subjectivity

02:51:38.909 --> 02:51:48.077
to be like someone from their generation with the same interests, in New York, Toronto, or Paris.

02:51:48.077 --> 02:51:50.123
It differs.

02:51:50.123 --> 02:51:54.320
But mentally at least they entered modernity, even in the village

02:51:54.320 --> 02:51:57.548
There is no village in the world today that I know of

02:51:57.548 --> 02:52:00.375
unless it's not on the world map

02:52:00.375 --> 02:52:03.839
or that they don't have smart phones.

02:52:03.839 --> 02:52:09.606
But if you have an iPhone then you're a modernist. 

02:52:09.606 --> 02:52:14.589
Is the antithesis of modernity or modernist man, 

02:52:14.589 --> 02:52:19.174
the underdeveloped person who doesn't have technology?

02:52:19.174 --> 02:52:21.561
Because you connected it with technology.

02:52:21.561 --> 02:52:24.832
As we stand today at this crossroads,

02:52:24.832 --> 02:52:34.456
the antithesis of modernism is one of the most positive things we can find.

02:52:34.456 --> 02:52:39.031
Even if he thinks he's backward, the backward is better than modernist today.

02:52:39.031 --> 02:52:40.678
Why?

02:52:40.678 --> 02:52:43.913
Because we are in a very big dilemma.

02:52:43.913 --> 02:52:47.743
In 30 years, we will destroy ourselves environmentally.

02:52:47.743 --> 02:52:50.721
In terms of weather and floods.

02:52:50.721 --> 02:52:54.503
If we don't take serious steps in these 30 years

02:52:54.503 --> 02:52:55.896
to improve the situation

02:52:55.896 --> 02:52:59.561
All of Bangladesh and a section of India,

02:52:59.561 --> 02:53:04.029
and large islands of the world and Netherlands will go under the sea

02:53:04.029 --> 02:53:11.526
Today, every year, 100,000 people between the ages of 15 and 30 commit suicide

02:53:11.526 --> 02:53:14.289
more than last year.

02:53:14.289 --> 02:53:17.243
So I ask my students

02:53:17.243 --> 02:53:19.295
How many young man and woman

02:53:19.295 --> 02:53:23.950
Between 15-30 is still young, correct?

02:53:23.950 --> 02:53:27.976
How many young people from around the world commit suicide yearly?

02:53:27.976 --> 02:53:30.715
No one of my students knows.

02:53:30.715 --> 02:53:36.290
They have no reason to commit suicide, the best of life are in front of them.

02:53:36.290 --> 02:53:42.105
1,200,000 young people commit suicide every year in the world.

02:53:42.105 --> 02:53:45.515
I want you to put 1,200,000 people

02:53:45.515 --> 02:53:48.195
In a big square.

02:53:48.195 --> 02:53:52.946
And look at how many they are wan; These people commit suicide each year.

02:53:52.946 --> 02:53:54.391
Not to mention illness.

02:53:54.391 --> 02:53:57.004
- This is only from the young people?
- (Yes.)

02:53:57.004 --> 02:53:59.219
Mental illnesses

02:53:59.219 --> 02:54:03.258
As far as I can say, the world is entering a new phase

02:54:03.258 --> 02:54:06.617
and with social media

02:54:06.617 --> 02:54:10.451
And how we entered the technological age and the computer age

02:54:10.451 --> 02:54:13.186
and a lot more.

02:54:13.186 --> 02:54:16.107
We have entered the age of madness.

02:54:16.107 --> 02:54:18.525
Madness?

02:54:18.525 --> 02:54:27.804
Now, mental illnesses are attacking the world in significant numbers

02:54:27.804 --> 02:54:30.355
So much so that the whole young generation

02:54:30.355 --> 02:54:32.175
who did not know

02:54:32.175 --> 02:54:33.867
Because they were formed before

02:54:33.867 --> 02:54:40.344
Like me, I was in a family that was very strong

02:54:40.344 --> 02:54:42.894
I have seven or six aunts

02:54:42.894 --> 02:54:45.509
and my mother and two grandmothers

02:54:45.509 --> 02:54:47.661
and uncles from both sides

02:54:47.661 --> 02:54:51.952
They all loved me, and they all took me as their son.

02:54:51.952 --> 02:54:55.187
Today, visualize how different things are

02:54:55.187 --> 02:55:00.668
Today at Columbia University, where I teach.

02:55:00.668 --> 02:55:04.027
One out of four

02:55:04.027 --> 02:55:09.079
students with a higher degree after a bachelor's degree.

02:55:09.079 --> 02:55:14.065
suffers from serious mental illnesses.

02:55:14.065 --> 02:55:19.059
How do I identify serious mental illnesses?

02:55:19.059 --> 02:55:22.681
It has tendencies toward suicide

02:55:22.681 --> 02:55:26.018
In Columbia University?
Yes, one out of five

02:55:26.018 --> 02:55:29.449
The statistics are there; It's not a guess.

02:55:29.449 --> 02:55:36.519
One-fifth of the undergrads suffer from the same problems.

02:55:36.519 --> 02:55:44.919
In every class, on average, one student commits suicide in Colombia each year.

02:55:44.919 --> 02:55:48.054
Sometimes two students.

02:55:48.054 --> 02:55:51.835
For a university that has 30,00 person, that's way too much.

02:55:51.835 --> 02:55:57.780
Too many in the world even for a young man or woman to commits suicide.

02:55:57.780 --> 02:56:04.822
Mental illnesses overwhelm us more and more

02:56:04.822 --> 02:56:08.963
Our young generation is the biggest victim.

02:56:08.963 --> 02:56:15.168
And in my opinion, the little ones today, if they are really thinking right about the situation

02:56:15.168 --> 02:56:18.845
They must start thinking in a way

02:56:18.845 --> 02:56:21.896
Because they are the ones who are going to pay.

02:56:21.896 --> 02:56:24.091
We were irresponsible

02:56:24.091 --> 02:56:26.923
We left them a very miserable situation

02:56:26.923 --> 02:56:29.723
They are the ones who will pay the price, and their children as well.

02:56:29.723 --> 02:56:33.668
And they have the right to revolt against this situation.

02:56:33.668 --> 02:56:36.747
I am saying revolution in the cultural sense

02:56:36.747 --> 02:56:39.491
I don't call for violence, ever.

02:56:39.491 --> 02:56:42.305
There must be a cultural revolution.

02:56:42.305 --> 02:56:45.642
They should start asking big and important questions.

02:56:45.642 --> 02:56:48.242
What is happening to us? Who are we?

02:56:48.242 --> 02:56:55.819
We are not made in this Earth to wreak havoc.

02:56:55.819 --> 02:57:05.263
If any people in all human history to destroy and corrupt Earth it is the modernists.

02:57:05.263 --> 02:57:09.078
Don't take it from me

02:57:09.078 --> 02:57:18.782
just use google and search for how many animal species disappear everyday.

02:57:18.782 --> 02:57:20.414
Could you answer it?

02:57:20.414 --> 02:57:22.659
I think it is a lot.

02:57:22.659 --> 02:57:26.527
110 daily.

02:57:26.527 --> 02:57:28.742
While the scientific average

02:57:28.742 --> 02:57:34.504
for the disappearance of species in the world, according to scientists in general, is five in a year.

02:57:34.504 --> 02:57:37.023
Let's say 50 a year

02:57:37.023 --> 02:57:44.712
Now, every day we lose more than 100 species of animals in the world.

02:57:44.712 --> 02:57:49.563
We destroyed everything we touched.

02:57:49.563 --> 02:57:53.109
But if you use different lenses

02:57:53.109 --> 02:57:55.351
yours are possibly pessimistic glasses

02:57:55.351 --> 02:57:59.320
With the new lenses

02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:06.266
It is true that there are new diseases like cancer,

02:58:06.266 --> 02:58:08.640
depression or other mental illnesses

02:58:08.640 --> 02:58:11.509
Or other diseases that have been discovered recently

02:58:11.509 --> 02:58:19.286
but we fixed diseases that the ancient man was suffering from

02:58:19.286 --> 02:58:21.701
So his life span is longer

02:58:21.701 --> 02:58:28.543
The average human lifespan 100 years ago in the Arabian Peninsula was 50 years, now it is 70 years

02:58:28.543 --> 02:58:31.334
It's increasing in America as well.

02:58:31.334 --> 02:58:34.583
The average human lifespan in the world has increased.

02:58:34.583 --> 02:58:37.392
This means his health is better.

02:58:37.392 --> 02:58:41.534
Although new diseases appears, they discover solutions to them.

02:58:41.534 --> 02:58:44.654
This is what I can say about diseases.

02:58:44.654 --> 02:58:51.692
As for wars, we live in an era that has the least wars in human history.

02:58:51.692 --> 02:58:56.983
Compare it with wealth and poverty.

02:58:56.983 --> 02:59:00.000
- Poverty rate are down.
- (Could we take them one at a time?)

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:03.396
- Poverty is less today than it was in history.
- (True)

02:59:03.396 --> 02:59:07.005
You have positive factors brought about by modernity

02:59:07.005 --> 02:59:11.799
We don't have to focus on the negatives.

02:59:11.799 --> 02:59:13.436
Mine is not a negative view.

02:59:13.436 --> 02:59:16.694
My outlook is more positive than the ones you defend.

02:59:16.694 --> 02:59:22.242
Because there is a bad interpretation of the positive outlook

02:59:22.242 --> 02:59:26.868
Sometimes the negative view is the one that believes more in the positives 

02:59:26.868 --> 02:59:33.178
A positive outlook can be accused of carelessness and irresponsibility

02:59:33.178 --> 02:59:41.549
Everything is good and happy and doomsday will come while we keep saying it

02:59:41.549 --> 02:59:47.516
My outlook is not negative at all

02:59:47.516 --> 02:59:50.422
I don't considered negative.

02:59:50.422 --> 02:59:55.060
and not as they say in English pessimistic and optimistic 

02:59:55.060 --> 03:00:01.019
Some people this is pessimistic.

03:00:01.019 --> 03:00:07.045
My project is all about criticism.

03:00:07.045 --> 03:00:11.598
My criticism is as positive as possible

03:00:11.598 --> 03:00:19.615
Because I think we should reclaim the concept of responsibility.

03:00:19.615 --> 03:00:21.360
When I criticize

03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:23.796
To whom I criticize?

03:00:23.796 --> 03:00:27.909
I could have retired a long time ago.

03:00:27.909 --> 03:00:29.765
I don't need to work.

03:00:29.765 --> 03:00:32.247
But I retire for what?

03:00:32.247 --> 03:00:36.813
My work and my worshiping

03:00:36.813 --> 03:00:38.915
my raison d'etre

03:00:38.915 --> 03:00:42.214
of course I love my family so much

03:00:42.214 --> 03:00:45.280
but my other raison d'etre

03:00:45.280 --> 03:00:50.239
is that I have work and responsibilities to fulfill.

03:00:50.239 --> 03:00:51.729
Why?

03:00:51.729 --> 03:00:55.061
Like most people

03:00:55.061 --> 03:00:59.569
when they reach their 30s or 40s, they have kids.

03:00:59.569 --> 03:01:02.010
Although this phenomenon is fading.

03:01:02.010 --> 03:01:05.230
But there are a lot of people who have kids.

03:01:05.230 --> 03:01:08.423
These new generations, what kind of world we will leave to them?

03:01:08.423 --> 03:01:11.444
If we are not going to make them aware that we have problems

03:01:11.444 --> 03:01:15.379
And be positive and tell them not to worry, go and do what you are.

03:01:15.379 --> 03:01:19.564
The clubs are there so start drinking and dancing

03:01:19.564 --> 03:01:24.397
Do whatever you like; Life is beautiful.

03:01:24.397 --> 03:01:27.498
Buy whatever you want and throw out what you don't want

03:01:27.498 --> 03:01:31.301
And consume half of what you buy; It doesn't matter because life is sweet.

03:01:31.301 --> 03:01:34.418
This is a catastrophe.

03:01:34.418 --> 03:01:38.310
But if you listen well to what I say

03:01:38.310 --> 03:01:40.245
and to the essence of my words

03:01:40.245 --> 03:01:42.794
What I'm trying to say is that we have to be careful.

03:01:42.794 --> 03:01:47.054
You can enjoy life

03:01:47.054 --> 03:01:50.361
I'm not an ascetic

03:01:50.361 --> 03:01:55.350
I have a life, and I enjoy it responsibly.

03:01:55.350 --> 03:02:01.016
The first thing in my daily life, I practice criticism.

03:02:01.016 --> 03:02:04.840
Because people must understand and be aware about what they do.

03:02:04.840 --> 03:02:07.251
My students say:

03:02:07.251 --> 03:02:11.234
After we took your courses, our lives changed.

03:02:11.234 --> 03:02:14.773
We don't have 'fun' as we used to.

03:02:14.773 --> 03:02:20.727
When they buy a Coca-Cola bottle and drink it and throw it away.

03:02:20.727 --> 03:02:24.486
Every student takes my class, almost never do it that way again.

03:02:24.486 --> 03:02:28.024
 And if he does, he will have remorse.

03:02:28.024 --> 03:02:31.595
This is from what he heard about the effect this simple action.

03:02:31.595 --> 03:02:36.998
A simple act, you go and buy a Coca-Cola bottle and pay two dollars and leave.

03:02:36.998 --> 03:02:38.578
You drink it and you leave it.

03:02:38.578 --> 03:02:39.939
Nothing is wrong with that.

03:02:39.939 --> 03:02:43.921
This act is haram.

03:02:43.921 --> 03:02:46.966
In the Shari‘a of modernity it must be forbidden.

03:02:46.966 --> 03:02:52.075
But since modernity has no morality, it doesn't have Shari‘a.

03:02:52.075 --> 03:02:55.473
You raised some points

03:02:55.473 --> 03:03:00.000
I don't want to be accused of avoiding what you said.

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:03.909
Like the issue of medicine and longevity.

03:03:03.909 --> 03:03:06.829
In medicine, as I mentioned a little while ago

03:03:06.829 --> 03:03:09.276
The goal of medicine

03:03:09.276 --> 03:03:16.950
But whenever someone does something, there will be side affects.

03:03:16.950 --> 03:03:21.637
The side effects of medicine is that we live more.

03:03:21.637 --> 03:03:26.436
This is what we focus on, and we applaud it; We become sick and we seek treatment

03:03:26.436 --> 03:03:28.400
What is better than this.

03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:30.886
We thank God for the medical apparatus

03:03:30.886 --> 03:03:33.483
Of course we thank Him for it

03:03:33.483 --> 03:03:40.276
We overlooked the genealogy of this phenomenon

03:03:40.276 --> 03:03:45.341
The metaphorical use of genealogy here is to ask: Why are we in the hospital?

03:03:45.341 --> 03:03:48.706
Because our old diseases that are before modernity

03:03:48.706 --> 03:03:52.431
very few and Almost non-existent.

03:03:52.431 --> 03:03:57.191
Most of the diseases that we suffer from today are modernist diseases

03:03:57.191 --> 03:04:02.765
When we say that 1 out of 4 people must suffer from cancer in his life.

03:04:02.765 --> 03:04:04.905
This is the average

03:04:04.905 --> 03:04:10.324
1 out of 4 also have to suffer from heart disease, and die from it.

03:04:10.324 --> 03:04:15.589
Cancer and heart diseases and many others

03:04:15.589 --> 03:04:17.961
Where did they come from?

03:04:17.961 --> 03:04:22.352
From our way of today's life.

03:04:22.352 --> 03:04:25.961
From Food or from pollution

03:04:25.961 --> 03:04:29.635
or the pressures on us

03:04:29.635 --> 03:04:33.097
Because anger and sadness generate diseases

03:04:33.097 --> 03:04:38.018
All the factors that exist in our modernity

03:04:38.018 --> 03:04:40.670
in our ordinary life

03:04:40.670 --> 03:04:45.041
they generates 80%-90% of diseases.

03:04:45.041 --> 03:04:49.470
When the medical apparatus say

03:04:49.470 --> 03:04:53.067
and you have to visualize here

03:04:53.067 --> 03:04:56.828
that the medical apparatus is talking to big corporations

03:04:56.828 --> 03:05:00.001
The medical apparatus says to them

03:05:00.001 --> 03:05:03.410
Give us money

03:05:03.410 --> 03:05:06.594
and we'll develop our medicine

03:05:06.594 --> 03:05:08.805
so we can cure people

03:05:08.805 --> 03:05:14.919
and people can keep consuming your food

03:05:14.919 --> 03:05:18.809
They is an alliance

03:05:18.809 --> 03:05:22.803
between hospitals and medical staff in every state

03:05:22.803 --> 03:05:25.324
especially in the United States

03:05:25.324 --> 03:05:27.874
With large corporations.

03:05:27.874 --> 03:05:33.150
Hospitals, by the way, have become companies.

03:05:33.150 --> 03:05:39.627
Before, doctors practice medicine through their own clinics.

03:05:39.627 --> 03:05:44.389
Every doctor, even two or more doctors, establish their private clinic.

03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:48.549
But now hospitals are buying these doctors.

03:05:48.549 --> 03:05:52.069
They get them into their line of work and pay them a salary.

03:05:52.069 --> 03:05:59.378
The salary is like the money you pay to enslave another.

03:05:59.378 --> 03:06:01.619
The doctors today

03:06:01.619 --> 03:06:04.294
are corporate slaves.

03:06:04.294 --> 03:06:06.213
They were independent.

03:06:06.213 --> 03:06:08.917
They were working with their dignity intact.

03:06:08.917 --> 03:06:13.299
Now they are just workers in large corporations.

03:06:13.299 --> 03:06:15.913
And they exploited them.

03:06:15.913 --> 03:06:19.034
These corporations are the same

03:06:19.034 --> 03:06:24.269
Every company has a special interest 

03:06:24.269 --> 03:06:27.688
to cooperate with the other companies

03:06:27.688 --> 03:06:29.570
Just like wolves.

03:06:29.570 --> 03:06:33.859
The wolves get together to hunt the bigger prey.

03:06:33.859 --> 03:06:38.406
The corporations do the same as wolves do, because they from the same kind.

03:06:38.406 --> 03:06:42.227
The corporation will not do good to me as a person

03:06:42.227 --> 03:06:44.298
a person who call for ethics

03:06:44.298 --> 03:06:47.050
They'll accuse me of sabotaging their work

03:06:47.050 --> 03:06:48.651
You are the enemy

03:06:48.651 --> 03:06:56.817
The best way to change the regime

03:06:56.817 --> 03:06:59.541
culturally

03:06:59.541 --> 03:07:04.224
we start by boycotting companies

03:07:04.224 --> 03:07:07.058
If you boycotting companies

03:07:07.058 --> 03:07:11.781
The less they produce and the less they use the land

03:07:11.781 --> 03:07:16.495
Let's say the red meat, or beef

03:07:16.495 --> 03:07:23.686
It's well established that it causes cancer

03:07:23.686 --> 03:07:27.197
No need for me to confirm it more

03:07:27.197 --> 03:07:32.316
Cows eat fodder

03:07:32.316 --> 03:07:35.819
And fodder is grown in large vast lands

03:07:35.819 --> 03:07:43.092
Whole forests are mowed and destroyed in order to grow fodder for cows.

03:07:43.092 --> 03:07:47.750
Who does that? The corporations.

03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:50.319
When they do things like this

03:07:50.319 --> 03:07:58.080
and I only eat one-fifth of what I used to eat from beef.

03:07:58.080 --> 03:08:00.001
That's enough.

03:08:00.001 --> 03:08:03.360
We consume more than what we need.

03:08:03.360 --> 03:08:05.618
It causes obesity

03:08:05.618 --> 03:08:08.126
America has the frightening problem of obesity.

03:08:08.126 --> 03:08:12.537
And other states, like England

03:08:12.537 --> 03:08:14.690
and the Gulf states

03:08:14.690 --> 03:08:15.751
It's common now.

03:08:15.751 --> 03:08:19.080
If you buy less beef

03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:22.109
The companies will not find a market

03:08:22.109 --> 03:08:25.644
They will reduce their production

03:08:25.644 --> 03:08:28.430
There we'll be less exploitation of the land

03:08:28.430 --> 03:08:30.921
less destruction to forests

03:08:30.921 --> 03:08:34.681
When the corporation shrink

03:08:34.681 --> 03:08:37.847
In that time we can accept smaller companies.

03:08:37.847 --> 03:08:39.989
that meet our needs

03:08:39.989 --> 03:08:43.741
But those giant corporations have occupied the world

03:08:43.741 --> 03:08:47.677
Don't you see that the modernity or its tools

03:08:47.677 --> 03:08:50.463
create these new corporations

03:08:50.463 --> 03:08:54.585
And the movements that help

03:08:54.585 --> 03:08:57.842
with this new culture you seek

03:08:57.842 --> 03:09:00.787
and recycling is increasing

03:09:00.787 --> 03:09:07.186
I mean the culture of recycling

03:09:07.186 --> 03:09:15.177
People are eating less processed food whether red meat or others

03:09:15.177 --> 03:09:18.468
and less use of plastics

03:09:18.468 --> 03:09:22.669
There is a big movement that is seen

03:09:22.669 --> 03:09:25.255
to lessen and improve

03:09:25.255 --> 03:09:28.736
and they belong to the tools of modernity.

03:09:28.736 --> 03:09:31.798
What you said is true.

03:09:31.798 --> 03:09:34.063
(Isn't it fixing itself?)

03:09:34.063 --> 03:09:36.698
Without morals.

03:09:36.698 --> 03:09:41.158
But not according to the time speed of today.

03:09:41.158 --> 03:09:44.404
What we do is very little.

03:09:44.404 --> 03:09:46.528
It should be a lot more.

03:09:46.528 --> 03:09:49.642
But you have to look at these Improvements

03:09:49.642 --> 03:09:53.547
A lot of these improvements are part of the same logic

03:09:53.547 --> 03:09:57.419
That generated the problem from the beginning.

03:09:57.419 --> 03:10:03.578
When we say stop using oil

03:10:03.578 --> 03:10:07.017
Let's find other sources, like the air

03:10:07.017 --> 03:10:11.798
We create a multi-million dollar company

03:10:11.798 --> 03:10:13.390
and build it

03:10:13.390 --> 03:10:19.481
But my motives are to exploit with the same capitalist logic.

03:10:19.481 --> 03:10:31.162
The point where we don't make money from green technology,

03:10:31.162 --> 03:10:32.949
It stops.

03:10:32.949 --> 03:10:34.476
Definitely.

03:10:34.476 --> 03:10:39.676
We go back to what we said about the origin of computer

03:10:39.676 --> 03:10:43.058
it came from war and violence

03:10:43.058 --> 03:10:49.711
Let's start over and attack it from another angle

03:10:49.711 --> 03:10:54.312
You can't solve a problem

03:10:54.312 --> 03:11:01.521
through a solution produced from the same logic that produced the problem.

03:11:01.521 --> 03:11:04.084
This is rule number one.

03:11:04.084 --> 03:11:06.217
Impossible.

03:11:06.217 --> 03:11:08.670
Modernity proved this law

03:11:08.670 --> 03:11:12.917
We didn't know this law, by the way, in human history

03:11:12.917 --> 03:11:19.160
until the past two centuries and what happened in them.

03:11:19.160 --> 03:11:22.463
This is the logic of modernity.

03:11:22.463 --> 03:11:24.766
It tries to create a solution

03:11:24.766 --> 03:11:26.308
from the inside

03:11:26.308 --> 03:11:29.086
Let's get back to the acids in our body

03:11:29.086 --> 03:11:33.770
What should the solution for the acids in the body be?

03:11:33.770 --> 03:11:37.102
You modify your way of life.

03:11:37.102 --> 03:11:39.718
You do a kind of exercise.

03:11:39.718 --> 03:11:42.840
You eat differently.

03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:48.211
It is impossible for modernity and the logic of capitalism to say that.

03:11:48.211 --> 03:11:52.119
This is self-destruction for them.

03:11:52.119 --> 03:11:56.302
What they do is give you pantoprazole.

03:11:56.302 --> 03:12:00.351
Pantoprazole is very well known drug and produced in millions.

03:12:00.351 --> 03:12:03.292
You take it to to reduce the problem.

03:12:03.292 --> 03:12:08.255
But it wreaks havoc in the body.

03:12:08.255 --> 03:12:16.164
After a few years it causes cancer in the body.

03:12:16.164 --> 03:12:22.592
Pantoprazole is the modernist solution to a modernist problem.

03:12:22.592 --> 03:12:25.987
We got rid of the heartburn

03:12:25.987 --> 03:12:29.661
But we gave him cancer

03:12:29.661 --> 03:12:33.727
At least leave me with the heartburn

03:12:33.727 --> 03:12:36.538
I will give pantoprazole to cause you cancer

03:12:36.538 --> 03:12:40.229
then you go to hospital to pay $450,000 for the operation

03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:43.946
And these are true cases.

03:12:43.946 --> 03:12:45.892
If I went to the movement

03:12:45.892 --> 03:12:47.413
Abdel Wahab El-Messiri 

03:12:47.413 --> 03:12:49.648
will call it speeding up the movement

03:12:49.648 --> 03:12:52.602
which make it within the modernist system

03:12:52.602 --> 03:12:53.743
This is true.

03:12:53.743 --> 03:12:55.705
I won't evade it whether from here or from there

03:12:55.705 --> 03:12:59.052
We're in a predicament.

03:12:59.052 --> 03:13:03.417
We have to understand that we are in dilemma.

03:13:03.417 --> 03:13:06.055
Both of our generations 

03:13:06.055 --> 03:13:07.826
we're getting older

03:13:07.826 --> 03:13:09.499
although you're still young

03:13:09.499 --> 03:13:12.675
but you have children

03:13:12.675 --> 03:13:14.558
others have children

03:13:14.558 --> 03:13:17.141
and they are innocents

03:13:17.141 --> 03:13:19.195
They don't deserve what we do to them.

03:13:19.195 --> 03:13:24.865
Back to the points we've discussed

03:13:24.865 --> 03:13:28.778
You refer to morals as Taha Abdurrahman did

03:13:28.778 --> 03:13:34.612
Are morals equal to religion necessarily?

03:13:34.612 --> 03:13:37.073
He spent his life in this discussion.

03:13:37.073 --> 03:13:40.246
Honestly, for me, this is not an important question.

03:13:40.246 --> 03:13:42.165
It's important for him though.

03:13:42.165 --> 03:13:44.422
Because of his own circumstances.

03:13:44.422 --> 03:13:48.372
This is what I concluded from what you said earlier.

03:13:48.372 --> 03:13:50.992
For example, in the 17th century

03:13:50.992 --> 03:13:53.302
they separated it from religion

03:13:53.302 --> 03:13:56.187
morality has necessarily been displaced.

03:13:56.187 --> 03:14:01.675
You placed the 17th century as pivotal where morality

03:14:01.675 --> 03:14:03.596
displaced religion

03:14:03.596 --> 03:14:06.650
This depends on what do you mean by religion.

03:14:06.650 --> 03:14:09.646
The problem is that when you say religion today 

03:14:09.646 --> 03:14:16.663
In English it's called religion (in Arabic: diin) as Islamic religion

03:14:16.663 --> 03:14:22.243
For Muslims, diin is something

03:14:22.243 --> 03:14:27.975
and for Christian Europeans, or non-Christian Europeans in general

03:14:27.975 --> 03:14:31.101
religion is something different for them

03:14:31.101 --> 03:14:36.898
When you asked about the relation between religion and morals

03:14:36.898 --> 03:14:40.301
First what do you mean by religion?

03:14:40.301 --> 03:14:46.442
If you think that religion must always be heavenly in the Islamic sense,

03:14:46.442 --> 03:14:48.900
but I'd say, not necessarily.

03:14:48.900 --> 03:14:54.698
Religions like Buddhism and Hinduism

03:14:54.698 --> 03:15:01.378
They can create moral attributes

03:15:01.378 --> 03:15:03.858
In my personal opinion

03:15:03.858 --> 03:15:08.533
I think Islam is the one where it succeeded the most in this project

03:15:08.533 --> 03:15:10.607
in my personal opinion

03:15:10.607 --> 03:15:15.132
But I don't want to say that all the others have failed.

03:15:15.132 --> 03:15:23.693
So it is possible that you have a religion in the sense that I can define

03:15:23.693 --> 03:15:27.946
You stretch religion to a certain point

03:15:27.946 --> 03:15:30.000
but not all the way

03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:32.732
or there will things that are not religious

03:15:32.732 --> 03:15:34.838
According to my concept

03:15:34.838 --> 03:15:38.677
If you extend religion as far as possible.

03:15:38.677 --> 03:15:42.245
There will be a direct relationship between morality and religion

03:15:42.245 --> 03:15:47.348
It's hard to do with a solid moral system

03:15:47.348 --> 03:15:51.692
and with a coherent and logical moral system

03:15:51.692 --> 03:15:57.257
and a moral system that can form the human self

03:15:57.257 --> 03:16:01.155
effectively at the individual level and at the social level.

03:16:01.155 --> 03:16:06.910
If it is not linked to cosmological and metaphysical movement?

03:16:06.910 --> 03:16:10.410
We are a part of the universe

03:16:10.410 --> 03:16:13.871
And if we pretended that we live here

03:16:13.871 --> 03:16:15.984
and God exists or not,

03:16:15.984 --> 03:16:17.322
God forbid,

03:16:17.322 --> 03:16:19.765
these are worthless superstitions.

03:16:19.765 --> 03:16:23.515
As long as we know that we exist

03:16:23.515 --> 03:16:27.262
as it surprised me when I learned, 20 years ago,

03:16:27.262 --> 03:16:31.705
that we are made of the same materials

03:16:31.705 --> 03:16:35.966
that made the rocks that fell from the spaces

03:16:35.966 --> 03:16:38.129
the meteorites.

03:16:38.129 --> 03:16:42.247
They analyze the metals in meteorites

03:16:42.247 --> 03:16:47.141
and approximately 98, 99% of its minerals are present in the human body

03:16:47.141 --> 03:16:50.026
And it came from space.

03:16:50.026 --> 03:16:57.010
Just knowing that and that we're on a very small planet

03:16:57.010 --> 03:17:00.001
between billions and billions of planets

03:17:00.001 --> 03:17:03.296
which we don't know where they begin or end

03:17:03.296 --> 03:17:07.814
and we can't know anything about them except the two or three around us

03:17:07.814 --> 03:17:10.684
and we don't even know enough about them.

03:17:10.684 --> 03:17:14.623
What is this universe? There must be something.

03:17:14.623 --> 03:17:19.117
We are not here in vain.

03:17:19.117 --> 03:17:22.275
Everything is interconnected with each other.

03:17:22.275 --> 03:17:26.588
We're cousins to the monkey 

03:17:26.588 --> 03:17:29.896
and monkeys are the cousins of the next animal.

03:17:29.896 --> 03:17:31.834
The elephant relates to the giraffe,

03:17:31.834 --> 03:17:35.809
We are all from the earth, and to the earth we return.

03:17:35.809 --> 03:17:39.476
All of this is religion.

03:17:39.476 --> 03:17:43.569
Small minds think religion

03:17:43.569 --> 03:17:47.065
is about a God with a beard

03:17:47.065 --> 03:17:48.895
even Christians think that

03:17:48.895 --> 03:17:53.072
A God with a beard, trying experiments

03:17:53.072 --> 03:17:56.261
God is everywhere

03:17:56.261 --> 03:17:58.750
In mountains and trees, in animals and man

03:17:58.750 --> 03:18:02.272
In the light, in the wind, in the fire

03:18:02.272 --> 03:18:03.679
He is everywhere

03:18:03.679 --> 03:18:07.006
We are one. We are all one.

03:18:07.006 --> 03:18:14.271
When I say we, it means all of us with our soil, our mountains, our planets.

03:18:14.271 --> 03:18:18.726
With our animals, our brothers on Earth

03:18:18.726 --> 03:18:22.327
I want to know a few things.

03:18:22.327 --> 03:18:28.363
Today, with modernity, many concepts have become

03:18:28.363 --> 03:18:31.833
We take them as postulates

03:18:31.833 --> 03:18:34.528
that they are the concept

03:18:34.528 --> 03:18:37.179
At the beginning of our talk, you mentioned freedom

03:18:37.179 --> 03:18:43.874
Was freedom present in the Islamic heritage?

03:18:43.874 --> 03:18:45.547
Of course.

03:18:45.547 --> 03:18:50.145
I mentioned that freedom is not one kind

03:18:50.145 --> 03:18:52.849
but different kinds.

03:18:52.849 --> 03:18:56.129
We know about another type

03:18:56.129 --> 03:18:59.494
which is has the same strength and merit

03:18:59.494 --> 03:19:04.684
it even has a lot more merits than the freedom we know today.

03:19:04.684 --> 03:19:11.832
Today's freedom is the freedom to act unhindered

03:19:11.832 --> 03:19:15.732
by the state or others

03:19:15.732 --> 03:19:21.311
If I wanted to smoke, I'll smoke, and if I don't want to smoke, I won't smoke.

03:19:21.311 --> 03:19:25.123
No one can impose his will on me.

03:19:25.123 --> 03:19:27.281
But think about it

03:19:27.281 --> 03:19:32.581
You don't have the freedom to say, I don't want this law, I want a another one.

03:19:32.581 --> 03:19:36.795
Today's freedom does not mean comprehensive freedom.

03:19:36.795 --> 03:19:41.216
It's a freedom Isaiah Berlin called 

03:19:41.216 --> 03:19:43.585
negative liberty.

03:19:43.585 --> 03:19:51.387
It is the freedom to act without obstacles that undermine your rights as a citizen

03:19:51.387 --> 03:19:54.696
These liberties are made in the first place 

03:19:54.696 --> 03:19:57.756
while it appear to be political liberties

03:19:57.756 --> 03:20:02.199
But they are basically made to be material economic liberties.

03:20:02.199 --> 03:20:06.489
The primary goal of the state is always the economy.

03:20:06.489 --> 03:20:08.424
Economy brings in money

03:20:08.424 --> 03:20:10.908
Money create soldiers and armies

03:20:10.908 --> 03:20:12.717
and power and a lot more

03:20:12.717 --> 03:20:14.666
like a spinning wheel

03:20:14.666 --> 03:20:20.587
There is a frightening cooperation between capitalism and the state.

03:20:20.587 --> 03:20:24.903
Capitalism and the state are the two biggest projects undertaken by modernity.

03:20:24.903 --> 03:20:34.228
They are the two main central domains in modernist life.

03:20:34.228 --> 03:20:36.642
We said that in Islam,

03:20:36.642 --> 03:20:42.123
the two central domains are Shari'a and Sufism.

03:20:42.123 --> 03:20:49.152
Today, the two central domains are the state and the and the material world.

03:20:49.152 --> 03:20:51.716
including corporations and capitalism

03:20:51.716 --> 03:20:55.071
Materialism is bigger than capitalism

03:20:55.071 --> 03:20:57.930
Capitalism is not only a practice

03:20:57.930 --> 03:20:59.729
but a philosophy

03:20:59.729 --> 03:21:03.507
and philosophy of life

03:21:03.507 --> 03:21:06.739
All of this is called

03:21:06.739 --> 03:21:11.820
buying whatever you want or not, which is mainly economical.

03:21:11.820 --> 03:21:14.717
But if you come to many other things,

03:21:14.717 --> 03:21:19.249
the state controls you and owns you in the first place, literally.

03:21:19.249 --> 03:21:22.160
Today, for example,

03:21:22.160 --> 03:21:26.644
When the state tells you to go to the army to fight in Vietnam or Afghanistan

03:21:26.644 --> 03:21:30.889
In America you are forced to go, and if you don't, you will be punished.

03:21:30.889 --> 03:21:34.135
And no one else can control this decision.

03:21:34.135 --> 03:21:36.154
Take Islam

03:21:36.154 --> 03:21:38.874
when there was a call for Jihad

03:21:38.874 --> 03:21:41.028
some decided not to go,

03:21:41.028 --> 03:21:43.381
but even those who decided to go

03:21:43.381 --> 03:21:48.120
if he is young and his parents refused, he can't go.

03:21:48.120 --> 03:21:51.000
If he is in debt

03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:55.869
and if the owner of the debt doesn't allow him to go, he can't go.

03:21:55.869 --> 03:22:01.295
Can you see the difference between the Islamic model of governance and the today's state?

03:22:01.295 --> 03:22:03.776
This liberty we have

03:22:03.776 --> 03:22:06.534
It's found in very large areas

03:22:06.534 --> 03:22:11.344
but it is held in other respects, and they call it liberty.

03:22:11.344 --> 03:22:14.069
But the liberty that I am talking about

03:22:14.069 --> 03:22:17.763
is the one Isaiah Berlin named it without knowing what it is exactly

03:22:17.763 --> 03:22:20.070
because he doesn't have a clear idea about it.

03:22:20.070 --> 03:22:22.728
But Foucault knows a lot about it

03:22:22.728 --> 03:22:27.983
Foucault is the only philosopher in modernity who knows more about it than anyone else.

03:22:27.983 --> 03:22:30.826
He wrote about it in about 15 books.

03:22:30.826 --> 03:22:35.469
It's described as 'freedom from'

03:22:35.469 --> 03:22:37.661
And not 'freedom to'

03:22:37.661 --> 03:22:40.207
The first one, the negative liberty

03:22:40.207 --> 03:22:42.108
is about the ''freedom to''

03:22:42.108 --> 03:22:44.137
I'm free to do what I want.

03:22:44.137 --> 03:22:47.735
free to buy what I want within the law.

03:22:47.735 --> 03:22:50.045
However, the 'freedom from'

03:22:50.045 --> 03:22:55.878
is if I've reached contentment within myself

03:22:55.878 --> 03:22:59.329
and happiness and joy

03:22:59.329 --> 03:23:01.957
and even to Sufism excitement

03:23:01.957 --> 03:23:04.829
without buying a new car

03:23:04.829 --> 03:23:08.030
or eating that big slice of pure meat

03:23:08.030 --> 03:23:11.819
Because I'm self-convinced without the need for the materials

03:23:11.819 --> 03:23:13.848
This is the true freedom.

03:23:13.848 --> 03:23:16.028
I am 'free from'

03:23:16.028 --> 03:23:19.546
Why do we call it in Arabic hur (free)

03:23:19.546 --> 03:23:21.342
that you freed it from

03:23:21.342 --> 03:23:24.530
When you free a slice of meat

03:23:24.530 --> 03:23:26.896
from the body of an animal

03:23:26.896 --> 03:23:30.208
to free it or to free the rip

03:23:30.208 --> 03:23:31.608
it means you have cut it

03:23:31.608 --> 03:23:34.799
Freeing (tahrir in Arabic) is about finding the limits of something

03:23:34.799 --> 03:23:37.300
and you take it and you say, This is it.

03:23:37.300 --> 03:23:40.904
It is like editing (also tahrir in Arabic) books. It's the same principle.

03:23:40.904 --> 03:23:47.466
Freedom is to be free from within.

03:23:47.466 --> 03:23:50.855
Without needing anything

03:23:50.855 --> 03:23:57.150
And when all your feelings and all your being depend on the fact 

03:23:57.150 --> 03:24:01.998
that you will not be perfect unless you buy a Mercedes car

03:24:01.998 --> 03:24:05.075
then you have became a slave to it.

03:24:05.075 --> 03:24:10.195
The first one, the 'freedom from' is an enslavement freedom.

03:24:10.195 --> 03:24:14.038
And the 'freedom to' is the pure freedom.

03:24:14.038 --> 03:24:17.543
No one will be able to break you.

03:24:17.543 --> 03:24:19.774
It might be the other way around

03:24:19.774 --> 03:24:21.753
The 'freedom from' is the pure freedom.

03:24:21.753 --> 03:24:24.205
Yes, the 'freedom from' is the pure freedom.

03:24:24.205 --> 03:24:29.490
I can be a perfect human being within me.

03:24:29.490 --> 03:24:30.666
Strong

03:24:30.666 --> 03:24:34.740
I have that strong inner citadel that we talked about.

03:24:34.740 --> 03:24:39.361
A powerful citadel inside me that suffices me

03:24:39.361 --> 03:24:46.283
without the need to live in a luxury house

03:24:46.283 --> 03:24:49.284
or to owe money until Judgment Day

03:24:49.284 --> 03:24:53.603
just to be able to buy a luxury car to show my neighbors and friends

03:24:53.603 --> 03:24:55.494
This is slavery

03:24:55.494 --> 03:24:58.857
And as many people have written,

03:24:58.857 --> 03:25:03.613
especially about debt and what is debt, etc.

03:25:03.613 --> 03:25:06.959
They said that today

03:25:06.959 --> 03:25:14.225
we are slaves to capitalism even if we think that we are free.

03:25:14.225 --> 03:25:17.615
I want to take on other concepts.

03:25:17.615 --> 03:25:21.046
Equality for instance.

03:25:21.046 --> 03:25:26.283
What was this concept like before modernity?

03:25:26.283 --> 03:25:28.430
Was it present?

03:25:28.430 --> 03:25:30.868
All of these concepts

03:25:30.868 --> 03:25:36.328
We have equality, injustice, and justice. These ideas are popular today.

03:25:36.328 --> 03:25:39.635
Did they have a presence before modernity?

03:25:39.635 --> 03:25:47.863
Every society has a way of creating the necessary conditions

03:25:47.863 --> 03:25:51.442
to continue in life.

03:25:51.442 --> 03:25:52.983
Sometimes they suffer from some crises.

03:25:52.983 --> 03:25:54.319
All societies.

03:25:54.319 --> 03:25:57.802
The have their ups and downs.

03:25:57.802 --> 03:26:02.910
In these frameworks

03:26:02.910 --> 03:26:10.380
society always has the means to enable

03:26:10.380 --> 03:26:15.779
this things to spin around this wheel.

03:26:15.779 --> 03:26:22.287
Equality is a way to solve some problems

03:26:22.287 --> 03:26:30.423
so that society can continue its normal life.

03:26:30.423 --> 03:26:34.209
We can't say

03:26:34.209 --> 03:26:36.523
that our circumstances

03:26:36.523 --> 03:26:39.232
because it requires some kind of equality

03:26:39.232 --> 03:26:42.055
it must exist in any other society

03:26:42.055 --> 03:26:45.126
and we ask, Did they have equality or not?

03:26:45.126 --> 03:26:47.662
This question in itself is problematic.

03:26:47.662 --> 03:26:51.751
But was this dilemma present?

03:26:51.751 --> 03:26:54.501
There weren't problems of that kind.

03:26:54.501 --> 03:26:58.211
Because Shari'a, before the 19th century,

03:26:58.211 --> 03:27:01.495
had organized life

03:27:01.495 --> 03:27:06.055
and because of its importance to society

03:27:06.055 --> 03:27:09.933
and its holiness

03:27:09.933 --> 03:27:16.625
society accepted the provisions of Sharia almost as a second nature to them.

03:27:16.625 --> 03:27:24.949
Equality was not important to them in the sense that we interpret it.

03:27:24.949 --> 03:27:27.260
What is the meaning of equality?

03:27:27.260 --> 03:27:30.422
Let's say between male and female.

03:27:30.422 --> 03:27:35.497
As in the male and female are equal and have equal rights.

03:27:35.497 --> 03:27:38.616
But what does this mean?

03:27:38.616 --> 03:27:43.036
It means the female can work.

03:27:43.036 --> 03:27:49.288
And since she works the children will be at home

03:27:49.288 --> 03:27:52.818
and another person will take care of them

03:27:52.818 --> 03:27:55.868
What are the problems facing the children?

03:27:55.868 --> 03:27:58.004
Where is the father?

03:27:58.004 --> 03:28:01.314
Is he present in the children's life or not?

03:28:01.314 --> 03:28:03.311
Because he also has equality.

03:28:03.311 --> 03:28:08.161
If the female can go anywhere, he can as well.

03:28:08.161 --> 03:28:10.367
Ho about the children? The family?

03:28:10.367 --> 03:28:12.651
etc.

03:28:12.651 --> 03:28:16.149
Why do I use this situation specifically?

03:28:16.149 --> 03:28:21.000
Because why the female has a right to work?

03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:26.574
Because we are a capitalist society that measures everything with money

03:28:26.574 --> 03:28:30.939
When the woman becomes equal to the man

03:28:30.939 --> 03:28:39.531
she must do exactly what he used to do to be equal.

03:28:39.531 --> 03:28:45.368
If the man makes $100,000

03:28:45.368 --> 03:28:51.138
the woman must make about same.

03:28:51.138 --> 03:28:54.964
It became a material equality.

03:28:54.964 --> 03:28:57.633
But are men and women the same thing?

03:28:57.633 --> 03:29:01.573
The woman gives birth to the children and the man doesn't.

03:29:01.573 --> 03:29:05.777
When the children come, it's their responsibility.

03:29:05.777 --> 03:29:07.945
She has a little more even.

03:29:07.945 --> 03:29:11.615
It's not that she is forced to do it.

03:29:11.615 --> 03:29:15.904
But it's how nature works, because man can't breastfeeds his children.

03:29:15.904 --> 03:29:20.676
I'd love to do it for her if I could, but I can't.

03:29:20.676 --> 03:29:23.946
The mother is the only person who can breastfeeds her children.

03:29:23.946 --> 03:29:27.234
These are nature laws we cannot ignore.

03:29:27.234 --> 03:29:32.056
It enters into the problematic situation of equality.

03:29:32.056 --> 03:29:37.021
In my opinion, the Western woman, and the woman in general

03:29:37.021 --> 03:29:41.755
the more they are liberated, the more they are enslaved.

03:29:41.755 --> 03:29:44.946
Let's take a simple example

03:29:44.946 --> 03:29:50.641
Women are freed to go to the market and to work and bring money.

03:29:50.641 --> 03:29:55.204
Just like her husband, and sometimes more.

03:29:55.204 --> 03:29:58.343
She comes back home to cook

03:29:58.343 --> 03:30:05.890
because her husband is relaxing in front of football match

03:30:05.890 --> 03:30:07.959
and maybe he drinks as well

03:30:07.959 --> 03:30:10.543
While she worked all day

03:30:10.543 --> 03:30:14.333
and comes home to more work, surrounded by her kids yelling "mom, mom"

03:30:14.333 --> 03:30:16.970
few kids call their dad

03:30:16.970 --> 03:30:21.052
there are examples but not most

03:30:21.052 --> 03:30:24.628
She cooks and she does more

03:30:24.628 --> 03:30:30.986
Few men today who are equal to their wives in house work.

03:30:30.986 --> 03:30:33.716
Who is paying the bigger price?

03:30:33.716 --> 03:30:35.458
The woman.

03:30:35.458 --> 03:30:38.486
I don't mean that women shouldn't work.

03:30:38.486 --> 03:30:42.769
But you have many other considerations on the issue of equality.

03:30:42.769 --> 03:30:45.708
Muslims have figured it out.

03:30:45.708 --> 03:30:47.974
Everyone is assigned to a role.

03:30:47.974 --> 03:30:50.197
As al-Mawardi said,

03:30:50.197 --> 03:30:55.240
Every gathering is a collaboration.

03:30:55.240 --> 03:30:57.900
And everyone has his own importance.

03:30:57.900 --> 03:31:00.001
If you are housewife

03:31:00.001 --> 03:31:03.483
and someone says this is demeaning

03:31:03.483 --> 03:31:06.863
compared to who bring half a million dollar to the house

03:31:06.863 --> 03:31:11.305
this person is either blind to the truth

03:31:11.305 --> 03:31:14.500
or very stupid.

03:31:14.500 --> 03:31:16.864
Motherhood, in my opinion,

03:31:16.864 --> 03:31:23.073
and of course woman must be educated

03:31:23.073 --> 03:31:27.129
but when she is faced with motherhood,

03:31:27.129 --> 03:31:28.900
in a period of her life

03:31:28.900 --> 03:31:35.887
In my opinion, she should be appreciated more than a man who brings a million dollar home.

03:31:35.887 --> 03:31:38.420
However, this doesn't exist.

03:31:38.420 --> 03:31:42.151
Because when a mother have babies

03:31:42.151 --> 03:31:45.042
she doesn't benefit capitalism.

03:31:45.042 --> 03:31:48.022
Capitalism do not reward her.

03:31:48.022 --> 03:31:52.700
Few companies that give good rights

03:31:52.700 --> 03:31:56.065
Things are gradually improving now, as it should.

03:31:56.065 --> 03:31:58.924
I don't deny that.

03:31:58.924 --> 03:32:03.710
But for more than a hundred years

03:32:03.710 --> 03:32:08.846
women were enslaved because they wanted them to work and have children too

03:32:08.846 --> 03:32:10.388
without any..

03:32:10.388 --> 03:32:16.667
A woman must be at home, and she must be paid a very high salary

03:32:16.667 --> 03:32:20.496
because she is a mother.

03:32:20.496 --> 03:32:23.523
Does this happen in capitalism?

03:32:23.523 --> 03:32:25.324
No.

03:32:25.324 --> 03:32:28.028
The law of capitalism is money.

03:32:28.028 --> 03:32:30.001
There is no interest in

03:32:30.001 --> 03:32:38.309
Everything else is respected in the end, because it brings more money.

03:32:38.309 --> 03:32:43.882
If company gives donations to a museum or a charitable foundation

03:32:43.882 --> 03:32:46.935
because it reduce taxes and they put their name

03:32:46.935 --> 03:32:49.339
Rockefeller gives a lot of money, but why?

03:32:49.339 --> 03:32:54.613
Because of the moral and spiritual conviction and the theological?

03:32:54.613 --> 03:32:55.759
No.

03:32:55.759 --> 03:32:59.555
It gives him a big name

03:32:59.555 --> 03:33:02.456
people idolize him and love him more

03:33:02.456 --> 03:33:04.790
and this brings in more money.

03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:07.377
It's all about money.

03:33:07.377 --> 03:33:11.276
Equality is fundamentally a matter of materialism.

03:33:11.276 --> 03:33:16.713
There is not always a high regard for either men or women.

03:33:16.713 --> 03:33:21.126
The modernist human being is a disgraced one.

03:33:21.126 --> 03:33:25.555
Not to mention that he is empty within.

03:33:25.555 --> 03:33:34.000
The modernist state in your thesis the Impossible State,

03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:39.515
in summary, you say that any definition of a modern Islamic state

03:33:39.515 --> 03:33:43.095
is intrinsically self-contradictory

03:33:43.095 --> 03:33:45.035
And logically of course.

03:33:45.035 --> 03:33:47.650
Excuse me, but

03:33:47.650 --> 03:33:53.197
all the states are modern state

03:33:53.197 --> 03:33:58.040
We live in a modern state, I pray, fast and pay zakat.

03:33:58.040 --> 03:34:02.921
I practice all my Islamic practices.

03:34:02.921 --> 03:34:05.665
Where is the contradiction?

03:34:05.665 --> 03:34:08.600
I'd love for you to explain it more to me.

03:34:08.600 --> 03:34:13.749
Modern state

03:34:13.749 --> 03:34:21.794
It was established on the basis of separating morality from anything else.

03:34:21.794 --> 03:34:29.836
I could stop here, and ask you to analyze this statement.

03:34:29.836 --> 03:34:32.420
Correct, large and deep analysis.

03:34:32.420 --> 03:34:34.864
And you'll find all the answers there.

03:34:34.864 --> 03:34:37.548
Rather than getting into a long and wide maze.

03:34:37.548 --> 03:34:39.636
Just from this statement.

03:34:39.636 --> 03:34:47.315
The modern state is not interested in establishing

03:34:47.315 --> 03:34:49.955
a moral self.

03:34:49.955 --> 03:34:53.405
The moral self is the mayor of a responsible society.

03:34:53.405 --> 03:34:58.107
You cannot produce a responsible society without a moral self.

03:34:58.107 --> 03:35:03.531
Let me give you a small but important example.

03:35:03.531 --> 03:35:08.161
We'll take it from the end, as we say in Palestine.

03:35:08.161 --> 03:35:12.768
- Do you use this phrase in Saudi Arabia?
- Yes, we do.

03:35:12.768 --> 03:35:17.890
We now know that the family is almost dissolved.

03:35:17.890 --> 03:35:19.514
It was dismantled in the West.

03:35:19.514 --> 03:35:22.773
And it's coming to us in every state.

03:35:22.773 --> 03:35:28.899
In Saudi Arabia, Palestine, and Indonesia.

03:35:28.899 --> 03:35:31.737
It's dismantling

03:35:31.737 --> 03:35:34.981
Men refuse to marry more than woman.

03:35:34.981 --> 03:35:40.031
They expect a lot of troubles and big problems.

03:35:40.031 --> 03:35:42.402
He wants to be exempt me from it.

03:35:42.402 --> 03:35:45.003
Women almost don't want it.

03:35:45.003 --> 03:35:47.108
Both of them don't want kids.

03:35:47.108 --> 03:35:51.473
The institution of marriage is completely dissolving.

03:35:51.473 --> 03:35:53.563
But we ask why?

03:35:53.563 --> 03:35:58.094
We should ask why?

03:35:58.094 --> 03:36:02.271
Now let's go to the beginning in 1804

03:36:02.271 --> 03:36:05.189
In 1804

03:36:05.189 --> 03:36:09.928
The honorable professor Napoleon Bonaparte.

03:36:09.928 --> 03:36:16.777
He made a law and called it Napoleonic Code.

03:36:16.777 --> 03:36:22.595
Codified Napoleonic law.

03:36:22.595 --> 03:36:25.509
It changed the world.

03:36:25.509 --> 03:36:31.458
Because it was the first law codified in this way

03:36:31.458 --> 03:36:36.380
It brings all the authorities and power of the state.

03:36:36.380 --> 03:36:40.152
A section of this law

03:36:40.152 --> 03:36:43.808
under many other laws

03:36:43.808 --> 03:36:46.148
was for family.

03:36:46.148 --> 03:36:56.177
The state started enacting laws to redesign the family.

03:36:56.177 --> 03:36:59.409
When we say there is a legislation

03:36:59.409 --> 03:37:04.988
of course on the first level and that it's almost naïve

03:37:04.988 --> 03:37:12.026
The state legislated a law that is applied to all as a system.

03:37:12.026 --> 03:37:15.655
This is a correct concept, but naïve.

03:37:15.655 --> 03:37:18.807
The not naïve explanation

03:37:18.807 --> 03:37:20.661
is to ask the question of

03:37:20.661 --> 03:37:24.377
what is this law going to do to society?

03:37:24.377 --> 03:37:29.133
If you see it from 1804 until this day

03:37:29.133 --> 03:37:34.749
The laws of all states are laws to corrupt the family

03:37:34.749 --> 03:37:37.461
this is not their goal

03:37:37.461 --> 03:37:41.257
but its effects and consequences were the corruption of the family.

03:37:41.257 --> 03:37:48.905
The dissolution of the family today is completely linked to the laws and the capitalist system.

03:37:48.905 --> 03:37:51.475
Nothing else can explain them.

03:37:51.475 --> 03:37:56.513
Capitalist and the state laws

03:37:56.513 --> 03:38:01.405
This shows you that capitalism and the state work together.

03:38:01.405 --> 03:38:06.083
The family broke up

03:38:06.083 --> 03:38:10.817
because it's a small section of the big picture

03:38:10.817 --> 03:38:15.299
which the state

03:38:15.299 --> 03:38:21.521
decompose society and divide it into sections

03:38:21.521 --> 03:38:24.108
The goal of the state is 

03:38:24.108 --> 03:38:28.019
always to eliminate large groups

03:38:28.019 --> 03:38:30.759
which has its own internal rules and ethics.

03:38:30.759 --> 03:38:33.917
Let me give you a simple example

03:38:33.917 --> 03:38:36.415
If you look at the Middle Eastern states

03:38:36.415 --> 03:38:40.975
not Saudi Arabia, but Egypt and Israel

03:38:40.975 --> 03:38:45.067
Of course Israel has a colonial plan

03:38:45.067 --> 03:38:47.976
But it has something to share with Egypt

03:38:47.976 --> 03:38:58.431
Both want their Bedouins population to be in one concentrated area

03:38:58.431 --> 03:39:01.891
and don't allow them to roam with their tents

03:39:01.891 --> 03:39:07.023
but to give them homes to settle in it and with schools and whatnot.

03:39:07.023 --> 03:39:10.667
Because Bedouins are tribes.

03:39:10.667 --> 03:39:17.241
And tribes have devotion and respect for its own laws only.

03:39:17.241 --> 03:39:21.737
They want to roam and keep their habits and customs and they are independent people.

03:39:21.737 --> 03:39:24.477
Bedouins are free people.

03:39:24.477 --> 03:39:29.348
The most free people on earth in the last century were the Bedouins of the world.

03:39:29.348 --> 03:39:35.597
They live their lives as they will, but they face state opposition wherever they are.

03:39:35.597 --> 03:39:39.574
The state wanted them settled, because it want to dismantle them.

03:39:39.574 --> 03:39:42.061
It teaches them in its schools.

03:39:42.061 --> 03:39:46.931
It gives them its laws of marriage.

03:39:46.931 --> 03:39:51.262
Then it dismantle them to become single individuals that can be controled

03:39:51.262 --> 03:39:54.030
by the state and capitalism.

03:39:54.030 --> 03:39:57.321
This is the goal of the state.

03:39:57.321 --> 03:40:01.309
Wait a second, I want to go back to what is said.

03:40:01.309 --> 03:40:06.375
You asked me how the modern state can't be Islamic state?

03:40:06.375 --> 03:40:12.162
You are thinking that as long as I can pray and fast, it means that I am a Muslim living in a modern state.

03:40:12.162 --> 03:40:16.744
No, but modern countries are dismantling society under your feet.

03:40:16.744 --> 03:40:23.762
Not you, but the generation of your children,

03:40:23.762 --> 03:40:26.884
is going to face the same problems

03:40:26.884 --> 03:40:29.432
there will be family, aunts, uncles, or love

03:40:29.432 --> 03:40:31.379
from the big family

03:40:31.379 --> 03:40:34.096
They will be alone and miserable in the world.

03:40:34.096 --> 03:40:35.943
This is the fate of all.

03:40:35.943 --> 03:40:42.090
Millions on millions proved this before us.

03:40:42.090 --> 03:40:49.615
Are the dismantle of the family and the loss of all your relatives

03:40:49.615 --> 03:40:52.406
and they became strangers to you, a part of Islam?

03:40:52.406 --> 03:40:57.440
Islam mainly depends on the group.

03:40:57.440 --> 03:41:00.843
There is no Islam without a group.

03:41:00.843 --> 03:41:04.295
There is no good without the group.

03:41:04.295 --> 03:41:09.086
The good deeds, cooperation, affection

03:41:09.086 --> 03:41:12.939
love, and friendship in Islam isn't there without the group.

03:41:12.939 --> 03:41:15.860
The state dismantles groups.

03:41:15.860 --> 03:41:21.540
Maybe it's a bit slower in our states

03:41:21.540 --> 03:41:24.106
but in the end this is where it's headed.

03:41:24.106 --> 03:41:28.065
Is this because the state or globalization?

03:41:28.065 --> 03:41:35.791
Globalization is one of the modernity sides

03:41:35.791 --> 03:41:41.484
and the state and capitalism.

03:41:41.484 --> 03:41:47.439
It's like the ball of football

03:41:47.439 --> 03:41:53.372
shapes of octagonal stitched together.

03:41:53.372 --> 03:42:00.000
Each one has its place by the others and has its own content

03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:01.487
visualize it like that.

03:42:01.487 --> 03:42:03.187
This is modernity.

03:42:03.187 --> 03:42:06.203
You have globalization

03:42:06.203 --> 03:42:11.775
The modern science, and this has its own story that we haven't touched today.

03:42:11.775 --> 03:42:14.816
Science and its holiness

03:42:14.816 --> 03:42:19.730
Companies, economy and banks

03:42:19.730 --> 03:42:22.406
capitalism, and the state.

03:42:22.406 --> 03:42:26.737
All of them together make this phenomenon.

03:42:26.737 --> 03:42:30.259
Globalization is not different.

03:42:30.259 --> 03:42:35.708
It's one side or a dynamic section of the sections we talked about.

03:42:35.708 --> 03:42:39.399
When I talk about the state and capitalism, I'm talking about globalization at the same time.

03:42:39.399 --> 03:42:42.152
Even though I didn't mention it.

03:42:42.152 --> 03:42:44.392
It's like having a great Molokhia bowl

03:42:44.392 --> 03:42:47.639
I'm not referring to the meat inside

03:42:47.639 --> 03:42:51.217
but if you know how it was cooked, you'll know it's there.

03:42:51.217 --> 03:42:53.771
It'll include the meat.

03:42:53.771 --> 03:42:59.393
It's like the logical people say, it is included

03:42:59.393 --> 03:43:09.153
If I said that she is a mother,

03:43:09.153 --> 03:43:14.211
this means there are children, even if I didn't mention it.

03:43:14.211 --> 03:43:16.723
Naturally.

03:43:16.723 --> 03:43:23.199
This is the difficulty of education.

03:43:23.199 --> 03:43:26.890
If I talked about the state, for instance,

03:43:26.890 --> 03:43:30.001
how about this and that

03:43:30.001 --> 03:43:34.721
What you do is to answer it from another door

03:43:34.721 --> 03:43:39.909
Every phenomenon that has an explanation, is a city with seven gates.

03:43:39.909 --> 03:43:43.757
One door shows you a section of the city.

03:43:43.757 --> 03:43:48.465
To understand the explanation fully, you have to go through all the seven.

03:43:48.465 --> 03:43:52.095
I always say that science is a mountain

03:43:52.095 --> 03:43:54.322
and we are the scientists.

03:43:54.322 --> 03:43:58.499
To understand what the mountain is

03:43:58.499 --> 03:44:00.821
you have to go all around it

03:44:00.821 --> 03:44:05.753
Because the mountain on one side can show you that it's high, but narrow.

03:44:05.753 --> 03:44:10.073
but from another side it will look like it's 50 miles long.

03:44:10.073 --> 03:44:13.433
It becomes completely different.

03:44:13.433 --> 03:44:16.021
You have to go around it to understand it.

03:44:16.021 --> 03:44:22.853
The modernist explanation can only be done by revolving around it and explaining all its sections.

03:44:22.853 --> 03:44:28.627
Sorry but take into consideration my ability to comprehension

03:44:28.627 --> 03:44:36.299
It could be awkward if we state some examples

03:44:36.299 --> 03:44:39.583
but in the Arab world there are many Muslim states

03:44:39.583 --> 03:44:42.508
even non-Arab state like Iran.

03:44:42.508 --> 03:44:45.417
There are Islamic experiments

03:44:45.417 --> 03:44:50.769
And if we say that the modern state is a European product.

03:44:50.769 --> 03:44:55.090
At the beginning of the conversation we were also talking about

03:44:55.090 --> 03:44:58.563
whether Omar Ibn Al-Khattab or other caliphs

03:44:58.563 --> 03:45:04.467
Since he is a member of this world, he took what he took and left what he left

03:45:04.467 --> 03:45:07.338
It is true that you said there are positions of strength and  weakness

03:45:07.338 --> 03:45:12.162
But it doesn't prevent today that you as a modern state

03:45:12.162 --> 03:45:14.746
and you take this system of modern state

03:45:14.746 --> 03:45:19.227
And you take and plant all your values and morals in it

03:45:19.227 --> 03:45:24.433
To be a moral Islamic state.

03:45:24.433 --> 03:45:28.451
My dear.

03:45:28.451 --> 03:45:36.857
The elephant can't climb trees.

03:45:36.857 --> 03:45:41.020
This is the monkey and tiger job.

03:45:41.020 --> 03:45:44.054
The saw can cut wood.

03:45:44.054 --> 03:45:50.292
You can't use a saw to craft a diamond ring.

03:45:50.292 --> 03:45:56.711
Each device has a function and has a way of working.

03:45:56.711 --> 03:45:58.248
It has a goal.

03:45:58.248 --> 03:46:02.449
It has a genealogy and background.

03:46:02.449 --> 03:46:10.236
The state is not made in any way

03:46:10.236 --> 03:46:14.436
to develop, educate, establish and support moral values.

03:46:14.436 --> 03:46:22.399
Because if it did, it will cease to exist.

03:46:22.399 --> 03:46:26.857
The state itself, as Nietzsche said

03:46:26.857 --> 03:46:34.612
It's an immoral phenomenon.

03:46:34.612 --> 03:46:45.111
Established on the ruins of a death of morality.

03:46:45.111 --> 03:46:51.555
This animal died and gave the ground fertilizer

03:46:51.555 --> 03:46:57.939
To grow a tree that has nothing to do with the animal.

03:46:57.939 --> 03:47:03.678
On the remains of this animal.

03:47:03.678 --> 03:47:07.026
The modern state

03:47:07.026 --> 03:47:09.926
It can give you a small corner.

03:47:09.926 --> 03:47:14.421
This is part of the definition of secularism.

03:47:14.421 --> 03:47:18.740
Secularism says if you want to pray and fast

03:47:18.740 --> 03:47:21.468
We will give you a corner to do them

03:47:21.468 --> 03:47:25.111
But when you leave this corner, you can't say anything about religion.

03:47:25.111 --> 03:47:31.625
Because you can't preach any values that oppose state values.

03:47:31.625 --> 03:47:37.449
And when your value becomes a little bit popular and important

03:47:37.449 --> 03:47:41.108
You will become a danger to state

03:47:41.108 --> 03:47:45.482
The corner in the room will shrink and will be taken

03:47:45.482 --> 03:47:49.265
Give me an example about America.

03:47:49.265 --> 03:47:54.300
America claims to be a state of freedoms, and that it gives religions their freedoms

03:47:54.300 --> 03:47:57.228
in expressing their feelings and rituals.

03:47:57.228 --> 03:48:03.439
All these religious fields have

03:48:03.439 --> 03:48:14.068
no influence on, or no rights in drafting republican political entity.

03:48:14.068 --> 03:48:23.455
There is isolation between the private and the public.

03:48:23.455 --> 03:48:27.199
Religion belongs to the privet.

03:48:27.199 --> 03:48:31.100
The corner that no one can see you in it.

03:48:31.100 --> 03:48:33.142
You go home and do whatever you want.

03:48:33.142 --> 03:48:39.484
But we can't impose the religious morals of the state even for the majority

03:48:39.484 --> 03:48:42.139
on the general political

03:48:42.139 --> 03:48:46.054
Because it goes against the policy of the state.

03:48:46.054 --> 03:48:52.489
It was created to isolate religion and morality from everything else.

03:48:52.489 --> 03:48:57.335
It was originally created to solve a difficult problem in Europe

03:48:57.335 --> 03:49:01.244
which is religious wars.

03:49:01.244 --> 03:49:04.472
The state was a solution to religious wars.

03:49:04.472 --> 03:49:09.597
Today you can't expect that the state to adopted,

03:49:09.597 --> 03:49:16.478
The state takes the average of the populace

03:49:16.478 --> 03:49:20.331
that has the ability to change the political system, and it works according to it

03:49:20.331 --> 03:49:23.794
because if not, It's going to deteriorate.

03:49:23.794 --> 03:49:30.892
But no state can practice morals

03:49:30.892 --> 03:49:34.983
Because it will create a kind of politics,

03:49:34.983 --> 03:49:38.809
in which morality becomes a source of problems like in Europe.

03:49:38.809 --> 03:49:42.254
The church is the root of the problem

03:49:42.254 --> 03:49:44.616
It is not modern Europe

03:49:44.616 --> 03:49:48.297
The fundamental problem, in my opinion, is European Christianity 

03:49:48.297 --> 03:49:50.503
which is the origin of disasters.

03:49:50.503 --> 03:49:52.953
It's the one who created modernity

03:49:52.953 --> 03:49:59.178
Because modernity was an attempt to save Europe from miserable life it experienced

03:49:59.178 --> 03:50:05.736
and the heinous injustice that it has lived in for centuries and centuries.

03:50:05.736 --> 03:50:10.865
Can we say that this is the ability of man to develop and create a planet

03:50:10.865 --> 03:50:12.626
or a better life

03:50:12.626 --> 03:50:19.382
in that he could create new entities that do not necessarily have a religion

03:50:19.382 --> 03:50:29.184
but it is able to gather people of different religions and backgrounds

03:50:29.184 --> 03:50:32.131
to live together.

03:50:32.131 --> 03:50:37.984
So he created an entity, like the state, and it became an independent entity

03:50:37.984 --> 03:50:43.047
also you have companies, they also have limited liability.

03:50:43.047 --> 03:50:47.094
And this contributed to getting us to where we are today

03:50:47.094 --> 03:50:50.917
We discussed it if it was negative or positive

03:50:50.917 --> 03:50:53.200
but we can agree on something

03:50:53.200 --> 03:50:56.681
which is the technical and cognitive development that we have.

03:50:56.681 --> 03:51:03.386
Every community can gather all its categories..

03:51:03.386 --> 03:51:06.156
OK, take the Islamic rule

03:51:06.156 --> 03:51:12.441
That Muslims were ruling minorities larger than them in number

03:51:12.441 --> 03:51:19.820
OK, how did they gather them all while they managed to live better than today's minorities?

03:51:19.820 --> 03:51:23.109
Today minorities are persecuted, I mean look at Muslims in Europe

03:51:23.109 --> 03:51:27.929
Muslims in Europe suffer greatly in Germany and especially France

03:51:27.929 --> 03:51:35.955
They cannot establish their own mosques.

03:51:35.955 --> 03:51:41.183
Most Muslims in Europe pray in apartments.

03:51:41.183 --> 03:51:47.476
And they talk about Islamic history, saying that there was a kind of restriction for building churches

03:51:47.476 --> 03:51:53.314
I mean a very ugly hypocrite

03:51:53.314 --> 03:51:57.631
The minorities today, not all of them

03:51:57.631 --> 03:52:04.666
It is a very strange phenomenon, but it is not alone or unique

03:52:04.666 --> 03:52:08.296
That you sometimes have minorities for example, in Indonesia

03:52:08.296 --> 03:52:12.492
3% are Chinese, and by the way, they are usually Christians.

03:52:12.492 --> 03:52:17.080
They own the natural resources of the state

03:52:17.080 --> 03:52:20.426
But minorities in the West

03:52:20.426 --> 03:52:23.134
Black minorities

03:52:23.134 --> 03:52:29.480
Spanish, Japanese, Chinese or Korean minorities

03:52:29.480 --> 03:52:37.367
During Corona, we can remember how many Asians have experienced violence in America

03:52:37.367 --> 03:52:44.643
The Japanese as I mentioned to you in World War II

03:52:44.643 --> 03:52:48.861
Look at what happened to them, completely innocents, they have nothing to do with war

03:52:48.861 --> 03:52:55.364
And then they proved that they never had a relationship with the government of Japan in World War II

03:52:55.364 --> 03:52:59.257
But they paid a high price.

03:52:59.257 --> 03:53:05.677
Muslims in America, in New York, Arabs and Muslims are persecuted.

03:53:05.677 --> 03:53:10.168
They wiretapped them.

03:53:10.168 --> 03:53:16.068
I don't accept that minorities today are happy

03:53:16.068 --> 03:53:22.618
and even if they were and they were in the ideal place for them

03:53:22.618 --> 03:53:27.960
The first and last question for me that is related to almost every topic we discussed today

03:53:27.960 --> 03:53:31.093
What is the price of this project?

03:53:31.093 --> 03:53:33.363
Is the price the destruction of the earth?

03:53:33.363 --> 03:53:39.310
Anything that destroys the boat or ship I am traveling on in the sea

03:53:39.310 --> 03:53:43.798
I will not accept it, because it will end in my own mortality.

03:53:43.798 --> 03:53:48.678
What we do is that we build and build again to make our leaders happy

03:53:48.678 --> 03:53:52.225
and we make money and eat what we want.

03:53:52.225 --> 03:53:54.331
and life is good.

03:53:54.331 --> 03:53:58.440
The most important thing is that we ask the question, what is its price?

03:53:58.440 --> 03:54:01.321
Why and what is the need for it?

03:54:01.321 --> 03:54:06.508
Why do I need to eat 3 kilos of meat every day?

03:54:06.508 --> 03:54:10.499
No one asks these questions.

03:54:10.499 --> 03:54:16.519
hopefully people start to think a little bit more about what they are doing

03:54:16.519 --> 03:54:23.424
And everyone asks this, Who am I from the inside?

03:54:23.424 --> 03:54:26.004
What kind of human am I?

03:54:26.004 --> 03:54:35.052
Am I a human being who deserves to be in the group of people who

03:54:35.052 --> 03:54:39.087
love me? Do I do deserve their love and respect?

03:54:39.087 --> 03:54:44.276
What can I do to repay this debt?

03:54:44.276 --> 03:54:48.960
What can I do to be responsible to others?

03:54:48.960 --> 03:54:53.159
and to life in general?

03:54:53.159 --> 03:54:56.494
And the whole planet

03:54:56.494 --> 03:55:00.925
All of this start from the inside.

03:55:00.925 --> 03:55:06.378
Morality comes from the inside and not the outside.

03:55:06.378 --> 03:55:12.962
You say that if you want to establish a true Islamic rule

03:55:12.962 --> 03:55:15.830
consistent with the history of Islamic rule

03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:18.960
we must give the political system a moral nature.

03:55:18.960 --> 03:55:26.672
Do I get from this that there is a way to make the modern state

03:55:26.672 --> 03:55:29.626
with the mechanism of Islamic rule.

03:55:29.626 --> 03:55:32.687
There are two solutions.

03:55:32.687 --> 03:55:36.293
We either end ourselves and we are done.

03:55:36.293 --> 03:55:38.624
Maybe this is what we deserve.

03:55:38.624 --> 03:55:43.698
Or we wake up and start changing things.

03:55:43.698 --> 03:55:50.601
If we choose the second, modernity most be studied.

03:55:50.601 --> 03:55:55.233
It is necessary that it is studied because it is a destructive project.

03:55:55.233 --> 03:55:58.299
We must create from modernity

03:55:58.299 --> 03:56:05.481
If we are smart and wise, because modernity is very smart and intelligent 

03:56:05.481 --> 03:56:07.534
but lacks wisdom

03:56:07.534 --> 03:56:10.553
There is a vast difference between the smart and the wise

03:56:10.553 --> 03:56:14.421
The smart can be a saboteur and a destructive.

03:56:14.421 --> 03:56:18.407
And even mentally ill. It happens a lot.

03:56:18.407 --> 03:56:23.206
But the wise cannot do bad deeds.

03:56:23.206 --> 03:56:28.605
Even if he made a mistake he will fix himself to continue and get back on the straight path

03:56:28.605 --> 03:56:30.312
This is the wise.

03:56:30.312 --> 03:56:34.471
If we are wise we can get out of this issue.

03:56:34.471 --> 03:56:39.256
This predicament can only be solved by education

03:56:39.256 --> 03:56:44.646
e have to educate our kids

03:56:44.646 --> 03:56:48.877
from the moment they open their eyes to the world

03:56:48.877 --> 03:56:55.119
That there are values that they must adhere to.

03:56:55.119 --> 03:57:00.043
But we need a system that can

03:57:00.043 --> 03:57:05.573
gives us the necessary conditions, to raise these generations.

03:57:05.573 --> 03:57:08.915
Don't ask me about how to do it

03:57:08.915 --> 03:57:11.766
Because honestly, I tell you that I am tired of these things

03:57:11.766 --> 03:57:13.020
Really?

03:57:13.020 --> 03:57:15.051
But Taha Abdurrahman says it is possible to add

03:57:15.051 --> 03:57:16.840
But it's very hard

03:57:16.855 --> 03:57:21.089
I'm not giving up, but I'm very tired.

03:57:21.089 --> 03:57:25.968
Even when people understand

03:57:25.968 --> 03:57:29.797
They are not ready to do or give up anything

03:57:29.797 --> 03:57:33.754
Even when they realize, they don't do anything

03:57:33.754 --> 03:57:39.753
Let me be addicted to drugs, and I die an addicted and unaware. This is our behavior today.

03:57:39.753 --> 03:57:43.339
Maybe there is no alternative

03:57:43.339 --> 03:57:45.714
Is there an alternative to modernism?

03:57:45.714 --> 03:57:48.107
There must be an alternative.

03:57:48.107 --> 03:57:53.641
Europe was in unbelievable predicament, it's like they were in hell

03:57:53.641 --> 03:57:56.874
until the 14th and 15th century

03:57:56.874 --> 03:58:00.001
Then they entered modernity

03:58:00.001 --> 03:58:03.334
The way the did it wasn't without effort

03:58:03.334 --> 03:58:05.919
They worked and waited a lot to get in modernity.

03:58:05.919 --> 03:58:12.974
Their attempt was, and without a doubt, was with good intentions

03:58:12.974 --> 03:58:15.602
They wanted to fix their problems.

03:58:15.602 --> 03:58:19.672
They wanted to survive so the worked for the better

03:58:19.672 --> 03:58:23.973
I'll say this for them, they really tried

03:58:23.973 --> 03:58:26.517
They failed miserably.

03:58:26.517 --> 03:58:30.590
Even though they tried at the beginning

03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:34.127
Imagine how long it took them to enter modernity

03:58:34.127 --> 03:58:38.246
From an era where the church 

03:58:38.246 --> 03:58:41.470
was harsh, and their minds were sealed

03:58:41.470 --> 03:58:44.873
as well as a lack of comprehension

03:58:44.873 --> 03:58:47.557
They were living in a very violent and bad situation.

03:58:47.557 --> 03:58:49.903
They entered the Age of Enlightenment

03:58:49.903 --> 03:58:52.732
and they started developing things

03:58:52.732 --> 03:58:55.240
They progressed beyond what was required.

03:58:55.240 --> 03:58:58.101
Their science became colonial and killed people.

03:58:58.101 --> 03:59:00.148
But at least initially

03:59:00.148 --> 03:59:02.787
Ok, how did they get into it?

03:59:02.787 --> 03:59:05.776
They worked for two or three centuries

03:59:05.776 --> 03:59:09.318
before they could see the results of their work.

03:59:09.318 --> 03:59:11.296
But they have changed a lot.

03:59:11.296 --> 03:59:15.270
From certain aspects, they did change a lot.

03:59:15.270 --> 03:59:18.895
How did they leave what was before modernity to be able to enter modernity?

03:59:18.895 --> 03:59:22.255
We can escape modernity in the same way that we entered it.

03:59:22.255 --> 03:59:24.127
Can we get out of it?

03:59:24.127 --> 03:59:24.840
(Definitely)

03:59:24.849 --> 03:59:30.140
Are Arabs and Muslims supposed to work on their own project?

03:59:30.140 --> 03:59:34.991
Or are we supposed to work with the West on a new project for humanity?

03:59:34.991 --> 03:59:36.842
We should do them together.

03:59:36.842 --> 03:59:39.327
We must have our own project.

03:59:39.327 --> 03:59:41.403
We should work on it independently.

03:59:41.403 --> 03:59:44.392
We must work bravely and boldly.

03:59:44.392 --> 03:59:50.038
Because situations today demand the greatest amount of courage.

03:59:50.038 --> 03:59:53.385
Without boldness and courage, we can't do anything.

03:59:53.385 --> 04:00:02.270
I mean cultural courage and scientific courage

04:00:02.270 --> 04:00:05.614
We have to come up with our own method of thinking from the start.

04:00:05.614 --> 04:00:11.326
We evoke some or all important Islamic concepts.

04:00:11.326 --> 04:00:15.460
Which have been a positive factor in human history.

04:00:15.460 --> 04:00:20.335
The Islamic experience in the world, in all aspects,

04:00:20.335 --> 04:00:23.087
was a very positive experience

04:00:23.087 --> 04:00:26.674
They have built a wonderful civilization,

04:00:26.674 --> 04:00:30.071
full of ethics and sciences

04:00:30.071 --> 04:00:31.769
without any contradiction

04:00:31.769 --> 04:00:35.675
And other new things we don't know about

04:00:35.675 --> 04:00:37.414
that contradict all concepts

04:00:37.414 --> 04:00:40.182
For example, Islamic government systems

04:00:40.182 --> 04:00:43.578
It was superior to many of what we see today

04:00:43.578 --> 04:00:46.221
By the way,

04:00:46.221 --> 04:00:49.121
I'm working right now on a long and complicated book

04:00:49.121 --> 04:00:51.887
on this subject, the Islamic rule

04:00:51.887 --> 04:00:58.573
It is almost a vast explanation of the third chapter of the Impossible State.

04:00:58.573 --> 04:01:01.715
I mean it can reach up to 500, 600 pages, I don't know

04:01:01.715 --> 04:01:03.360
Where are you at now?

04:01:03.360 --> 04:01:07.194
I reached about 300 pages, but I'm still in the middle.

04:01:07.194 --> 04:01:12.922
All these achievements were Islamic achievements.

04:01:12.922 --> 04:01:17.648
We can't recall the whole past.

04:01:17.648 --> 04:01:20.544
Because what is past, is forgotten.

04:01:20.544 --> 04:01:22.998
But many things in Islam are not dead yet.

04:01:22.998 --> 04:01:25.381
We can get it back

04:01:25.381 --> 04:01:26.839
And we can build on it

04:01:26.839 --> 04:01:32.849
We can combine it and mix it with things that are suitable for the era we live in

04:01:32.849 --> 04:01:36.973
in order to get out of modernity.

04:01:36.973 --> 04:01:41.240
We must get out of modernity if we want to survive.

04:01:41.240 --> 04:01:46.216
If we continue with modernity and insist on it

04:01:46.216 --> 04:01:50.571
I promise you a promise of honor as they say, that we will all be ruined

04:01:50.571 --> 04:01:52.517
You'll see.

04:01:52.517 --> 04:01:56.530
We are like that right now

04:01:56.530 --> 04:02:01.838
Look at the natural and environmental degradation

04:02:01.838 --> 04:02:05.519
and to the physical and mental as well

04:02:05.519 --> 04:02:08.867
and to the family and the collective too.

04:02:08.867 --> 04:02:12.692
In one of your interviews

04:02:12.692 --> 04:02:15.198
I remember you said that

04:02:15.198 --> 04:02:18.260
there are Indian or Chinese movements

04:02:18.260 --> 04:02:20.969
 or movements from Indian and Chinese 

04:02:20.969 --> 04:02:22.877
They are trying to restore their history.

04:02:22.877 --> 04:02:25.664
In China

04:02:25.664 --> 04:02:31.052
They have a concept, but it's in Chinese which I can't speak

04:02:31.052 --> 04:02:34.522
But in English they call it circular history.

04:02:34.522 --> 04:02:39.031
This is a very huge and important project

04:02:39.031 --> 04:02:42.611
There's a third model, by the way.

04:02:42.611 --> 04:02:44.574
There is a second and a third

04:02:44.574 --> 04:02:47.324
You have the Chinese model which is the circular 

04:02:47.324 --> 04:02:49.062
You have the Western model

04:02:49.062 --> 04:02:51.474
The one we all adopt today

04:02:51.474 --> 04:02:55.281
It is the model that aspires to the future

04:02:55.281 --> 04:03:00.506
And you have the Islamic model that aspires to the past.

04:03:00.506 --> 04:03:06.220
These are the three models in viewing the human life that are very important

04:03:06.220 --> 04:03:13.440
Because they form the philosophy that man must live according to it.

04:03:13.440 --> 04:03:18.569
So let's take that the things that are close to us first

04:03:18.569 --> 04:03:23.731
Because the Chinese model becomes part of these solutions

04:03:23.731 --> 04:03:31.159
But if we look at the phenomena that are more suitable for us

04:03:31.159 --> 04:03:35.374
Because we from the Islamic world but we talk about Islam and the West

04:03:35.374 --> 04:03:37.982
Because it is the one that affected us the most

04:03:37.982 --> 04:03:41.024
The Chinese model isn't much right now

04:03:41.024 --> 04:03:42.379
It's going to be something

04:03:42.379 --> 04:03:44.865
But so far it didn't.

04:03:44.865 --> 04:03:51.357
You can see historical path

04:03:51.357 --> 04:03:57.350
In China, for them it goes in a circle

04:03:57.350 --> 04:04:02.018
You live and die

04:04:02.018 --> 04:04:09.987
It's a matter of life being always in a circular motion In the universe.

04:04:09.987 --> 04:04:13.102
What goes around must come around.

04:04:13.102 --> 04:04:18.018
If things will come back to you, you won't do bad things because you don't want it back.

04:04:18.018 --> 04:04:20.205
This is one of the principles

04:04:20.205 --> 04:04:23.204
In the West

04:04:23.204 --> 04:04:25.701
It is a Christian concept originally

04:04:25.701 --> 04:04:29.310
As I told you, the big main concepts are Christian

04:04:29.310 --> 04:04:33.282
The theory of progress

04:04:33.282 --> 04:04:41.366
This is one of the biggest theories affecting modern human thinking and behavior

04:04:41.366 --> 04:04:43.599
And not just in the West.

04:04:43.599 --> 04:04:46.717
We believe that there is always progress

04:04:46.717 --> 04:04:50.725
We destroyed everything but we still call it progress

04:04:50.725 --> 04:04:53.435
Because we have a better car

04:04:53.435 --> 04:04:56.797
and our computers are better, and this is progress

04:04:56.797 --> 04:05:02.684
It is not important that we are going down in misery, despair, and sadness

04:05:02.684 --> 04:05:05.159
and suicide 

04:05:05.159 --> 04:05:08.241
This is left on the side, because we are making progress

04:05:08.241 --> 04:05:11.502
Its origin is Christian salvation

04:05:11.502 --> 04:05:15.925
Our goal is the salvation

04:05:15.925 --> 04:05:21.348
The criterion of ethics in the theory of progress

04:05:21.348 --> 04:05:28.059
It is what we can achieve in the future, even though we know what will happen in the future.

04:05:28.059 --> 04:05:30.149
These kind of expected contradictions

04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:32.487
But when you look at Islam

04:05:32.487 --> 04:05:40.041
In history, the highest point of it is creation and the message.

04:05:40.041 --> 04:05:46.128
God's creation first, and the message of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace.

04:05:46.128 --> 04:05:47.212
At the top

04:05:47.212 --> 04:05:50.660
After that comes the corruption of time

04:05:50.660 --> 04:05:54.505
Whenever you are away from the prophet peace be upon him

04:05:54.505 --> 04:05:57.615
the more time passes, the more corrupt time becomes

04:05:57.615 --> 04:06:03.451
Some people find this difficult, and they think we want them in despair.

04:06:03.451 --> 04:06:08.371
On the contrary, this is one of the most positive things

04:06:08.371 --> 04:06:14.939
Because when we look at the era of the prophet and the prophet himself

04:06:14.939 --> 04:06:17.473
with the top endoscope

04:06:17.473 --> 04:06:20.905
he becomes the perfect human being, as the Sufis say

04:06:20.905 --> 04:06:24.859
And if he is the perfect human being, what is our duty

04:06:24.859 --> 04:06:28.598
We follow him and imitate him.

04:06:28.598 --> 04:06:34.136
We imitate him but with knowledge and not with ignorance

04:06:34.136 --> 04:06:38.212
We imitate him and try our best to be like him.

04:06:38.212 --> 04:06:45.462
It becomes as follows: looking back becomes moral advancement.

04:06:45.462 --> 04:06:50.154
This does not exist in the new theory of progress.

04:06:50.154 --> 04:06:55.120
The new theory of progress is that we are progressing more and more 

04:06:55.120 --> 04:06:58.838
just according to certain criteria, but morality is not one of them.

04:06:58.838 --> 04:07:00.979
Morality is not one of them.

04:07:00.979 --> 04:07:04.526
Even when we say equality, this does not mean that it is morals

04:07:04.526 --> 04:07:09.972
Equality is a political and economic equation, but not a moral equation.

04:07:09.972 --> 04:07:14.827
The Chinese

04:07:14.827 --> 04:07:17.501
Have brought their history.

04:07:17.501 --> 04:07:22.628
As I invite the Muslims to recall their history

04:07:22.628 --> 04:07:27.704
From the point of the historical composition as I told you

04:07:27.704 --> 04:07:31.414
The Chinese are trying and doing the same thing

04:07:31.414 --> 04:07:33.768
They want to know the Confucian

04:07:33.768 --> 04:07:36.421
and to what the Chinese traditions invite 

04:07:36.421 --> 04:07:43.044
They want to recall it to give the modernist perspective or modernist reality

04:07:43.044 --> 04:07:46.030
a kind of humanity and morals

04:07:46.030 --> 04:07:50.953
Modernity is a complete opposition to humanity.

04:07:50.953 --> 04:07:54.223
Modernity killed the human being.

04:07:54.223 --> 04:07:59.741
We are not just meat and bones

04:07:59.741 --> 04:08:06.563
hat is more important than that are the soul and the self

04:08:06.563 --> 04:08:09.316
Self and soul, like the Sufis say

04:08:09.316 --> 04:08:11.229
And the self is the door of the soul

04:08:11.229 --> 04:08:19.772
It's the refinery that decides what goes in from bad and good.

04:08:19.772 --> 04:08:22.813
And decides according to what you want

04:08:22.813 --> 04:08:26.263
Hence the intervention of technologies of the self

04:08:26.263 --> 04:08:30.876
Technologies of the self controls the self strainer.

04:08:30.876 --> 04:08:33.259
Then it decides to refuse

04:08:33.259 --> 04:08:38.629
According to the general concept, the self is like a bowl

04:08:38.629 --> 04:08:42.323
When you fill a bowl of water and you put a drop

04:08:42.323 --> 04:08:44.018
it overflow

04:08:44.018 --> 04:08:46.140
This bowl is limited.

04:08:46.140 --> 04:08:50.606
If you put good in it, evil will come out.

04:08:50.606 --> 04:08:53.918
The more good you put in it the more evil come out.

04:08:53.918 --> 04:08:57.298
But if you put bad in it, good will come out.

04:08:57.298 --> 04:09:00.729
So you have to nurture yourself.

04:09:00.729 --> 04:09:07.030
In many ways, including prayer and fasting, just as the Chinese and Indians have their own ways.

04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:11.209
And Muslims have several ways, whether from Shari'a or Sufism

04:09:11.209 --> 04:09:15.755
Because Sufi ways are somewhat different from the Shari'a ways and go beyond it.

04:09:15.755 --> 04:09:19.334
Technologies of the self are too many.

04:09:19.334 --> 04:09:23.262
But the important thing is that they produce the same result

04:09:23.262 --> 04:09:29.952
Which is that the bowl of the self should filled with goodness.

04:09:29.952 --> 04:09:34.005
And when it is filled, it becomes a cover for the soul.

04:09:34.005 --> 04:09:37.182
It can be corrupted.

04:09:37.182 --> 04:09:42.199
"Every human being is born with Fitrah (innate characteristics, Natural instinct)

04:09:42.199 --> 04:09:44.626
It means he is a Muslim.

04:09:44.626 --> 04:09:47.256
But what ruins him?

04:09:47.256 --> 04:09:50.194
People who surround him and not good for him.

04:09:50.194 --> 04:09:54.440
This means that the Self allowed itself

04:09:54.440 --> 04:09:58.707
to let things come in and halt its Fitrah.

04:09:58.707 --> 04:10:02.531
It's not that it corrupted the Fitrah, but disrupted it.

04:10:02.531 --> 04:10:06.505
If the Self does good, it will be better.

04:10:06.505 --> 04:10:11.544
The Self is everything we own that has value.

04:10:11.544 --> 04:10:15.484
In it, we practice the technologies of the self.

04:10:15.484 --> 04:10:17.908
- May Allah bless you.
- And to you too.

04:10:17.908 --> 04:10:19.961
- Thank you very much
- You are most welcome.

04:10:19.961 --> 04:10:21.516
Thank you all.

04:10:21.516 --> 04:10:24.177
and to Ayman Al Hammadi, Fnjan producer

04:10:24.177 --> 04:10:28.145
Thanks to Abdul Majeed Al-Attas in coloring

04:10:28.145 --> 04:10:29.890
Mohamed Nour Shammat in editing

04:10:29.890 --> 04:10:31.825
Behind the cameras, Adam Al-Sha'arani

04:10:31.825 --> 04:10:35.262
From production, Aseel Ba farat

04:10:35.262 --> 04:10:38.646
Noura Al-Subaie in social media content management.

04:10:38.646 --> 04:10:41.402
Muhammad Al-Hasan in audio engineering

04:10:41.402 --> 04:10:44.415
Managing Editor of Fnjan, Aseel Ba Abdullah

04:10:44.415 --> 04:10:49.387
This is Fnjan, one of the products of thmanyah a Company for Publishing and Distribution

04:10:49.387 --> 04:10:52.130
We publish all the productions with love from the city of Riyadh.

04:10:52.130 --> 04:10:56.192
Next week, we meet.

04:10:56.192 --> 04:10:59.365
 

04:10:59.365 --> 04:11:02.099
I went to the the Met 

04:11:02.099 --> 04:11:03.500
Excuse me?

04:11:03.500 --> 04:11:06.146
The Metropolitan Museum

04:11:06.146 --> 04:11:10.066
When you find things that are not stolen

04:11:10.066 --> 04:11:13.790
How do the West justify them if they are not theirs?

04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:15.618
Listen

04:11:15.618 --> 04:11:21.250
You find it all over England. It is clearly attributed to Muslims and many others.

04:11:21.250 --> 04:11:25.410
You can find a section for Pharaonic monuments.

04:11:25.410 --> 04:11:28.419
(A copy of the Quran)

04:11:28.419 --> 04:11:33.773
The Western colonial view

04:11:33.773 --> 04:11:41.809
is that the truth consists of a viewer and the viewed.

04:11:41.809 --> 04:11:45.923
The viewer is the European which looks at the viewed.

04:11:45.923 --> 04:11:48.554
And the viewed one is the museum

04:11:48.554 --> 04:11:51.597
We are a museum for the European

04:11:51.597 --> 04:11:55.768
Even in what we call

04:11:55.768 --> 04:11:59.361
The aristocratic concerts in 19th century England

04:11:59.361 --> 04:12:01.490
When they were the colonizers of India

04:12:01.490 --> 04:12:04.804
They used to bring servants from Africa.

04:12:04.804 --> 04:12:06.532
Of brown and black colors.

04:12:06.532 --> 04:12:10.197
And from Chinese Asia

04:12:10.197 --> 04:12:16.856
And make them serve food and dinner for the English around the table.

04:12:16.856 --> 04:12:21.070
This is for looking at them as a revolving museum.

04:12:21.070 --> 04:12:31.903
As if they were monkeys, bears, tigers, and giraffes that are there for us to watch.

04:12:31.903 --> 04:12:37.485
Colonialism

04:12:37.485 --> 04:12:40.282
Not only occupies land

04:12:40.282 --> 04:12:43.916
But it creates from the indigenous citizen

04:12:43.916 --> 04:12:47.279
The Idea of its museum

04:12:47.279 --> 04:12:55.128
As Asians and Africans, we are museums of the West.

04:12:55.128 --> 04:13:01.479
And museums are a modernist project, right?

04:13:01.479 --> 04:13:04.325
(Of course)

04:13:04.325 --> 04:13:06.476
Modernity is a problem.

04:13:06.476 --> 04:13:10.000
Yes, a very difficult problem.
